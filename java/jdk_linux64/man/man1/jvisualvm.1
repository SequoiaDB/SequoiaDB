.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.LP
Java VisualVM is an intuitive graphical user interface that provides detailed information about Java technology\-based applications (Java applications) while they are running on a given Java Virtual Machine (JVM(*)). The name Java VisualVM comes from the fact that Java VisualVM provides information about the JVM software \f2visually\fP.

Java VisualVM combines several monitoring, troubleshooting, and profiling utilities into a single tool. For example, most of the functionality offered by the standalone tools \f2jmap\fP, \f2jinfo\fP, \f2jstat\fP and \f2jstack\fP have been integrated into Java VisualVM. Other functionalities, such as some of those offered by the JConsole tool, can be added as optional plug\-ins.

.SH "USAGE"
.LP
.LP
Java VisualVM is useful to Java application developers to troubleshoot applications and to monitor and improve the applications' performance. Java VisualVM can allow developers to generate and analyse heap dumps, track down memory leaks, perform and monitor garbage collection, and perform lightweight memory and CPU profiling. Plug\-ins also exist that expand the functionality of Java VisualVM. For example, most of the functionality of the JConsole tool is available via the MBeans Tab and JConsole Plug\-in Wrapper plug\-ins. You can choose from a catalog of standard Java VisualVM plug\-ins by selecting 'Tools' | 'Plugins' in the Java VisualVM menus.
