options 
The command\-line options. See Options. 
.TP 3
pid 
Identifies the process that receives the diagnostic command requests. The process must be a Java process. To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1). 
.TP 3
main\-class 
The main class of the process that receives the diagnostic command requests. When matching processes, any process whose main class name contains the specified string as a substring is matched. If several running Java processes share the same main class, then the diagnostic command request is sent to all these processes. To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1). 
.TP 3
command [arguments] 
The main class of the process that receives the diagnostic command requests. When matching processes, any process whose main class name contains the specified string as a substring is matched. If several running Java processes share the same main class, then the diagnostic command request is sent to all these processes. To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1). 
.TP 3
Perfcounter.print 
Print the performance counters available on the targeted Java processes. The list of performance counters might vary with the Java process. 
.TP 3
\-f file 
Read commands from \f2file\fP and call them on the targeted Java processes. In \f2file\fP, each command must be written on a single line. Lines starting with # are ignored. Processing of \f2file\fP ends when all lines have been called or when a line containing the \f3stop\fP keyword is read.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.LP
\f3jcmd\fP is a utility to send diagnostic command requests to a Java Virtual Machine supporting this feature.
.LP
.LP
Used without arguments or with the \f3\-l\fP option, \f3jcmd\fP prints the list of running Java processes with their process ID, their main class and their command\-line arguments.
.LP
.LP
When a process ID is specified on the command line, \f3jcmd\fP sends the diagnostic command request to the process with this ID.
.LP
.LP
When a main class is specified on the command line, \f3jcmd\fP sends the diagnostic command request to all Java processes for which the command\-line argument is a substring of the Java process' main class.
.LP
.LP
With the \f3PerfCounter.print\fP argument, \f3jcmd\fP prints the performance counters available on the targeted Java processes.
.LP
.LP
With the \f3\-f\fP option, \f3jcmd\fP sends to the targeted Java processes the diagnostic commands stored in the specified \f3file\fP.
