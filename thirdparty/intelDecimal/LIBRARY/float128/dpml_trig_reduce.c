/*
 * BASIC ALGORITHM:
 * ----------------
 *
 * It is assumed that this routine will be used VERY infrequently and
 * consequently the implementation contained here sacrifices some performance
 * for simplicity and uniformity.
 *
 * Let x' = x*2^bix + voc*(pi/4).  We want to produce
 *
 *		y = mod( x', pi/2 )/2^bix
 *
 * or equivalently,
 *
 *		I = nint( x'/(pi/2) )
 *		y = ( x' - I*(pi/2) )/2^bix
 *
 * We also want to produce an integer result containing the low bits of I 
 * (called the 'octant' bits) and some 'fractional' bits of I that can be
 * used as a table index (these are called the 'index' bits).  We also want
 * to compute and return y as two floating-point values, y = hi - lo, so
 * that lo provides some additional precision to the caller.
 *
 * More precisely,
 *
 *		x' = x*2^bix + voc*(pi/4)
 *		J = nint( x'/(pi/2) * 2^(NUM_INDEX_BITS+1) )
 *		I = floor( (J + 2^NUM_INDEX_BITS)/2^(NUM_INDEX_BITS+1) )
 *		y = ( x' - I*(pi/2) )/2^bix
 *		result = mod( J, 2^(NUM_OCTANT_BITS+NUM_INDEX_BITS) )
 *
 * [The following comments should be rewritten to be more precise.]
 *
 * Note that the reduce argument is in "radians".  For computational
 * purposes, it is convenient to first obtain the reduced argument in
 * cycles - i.e. compute y as
 *
 *              I' = trunc(x'/(pi/4))
 *              o  = low three bits I'
 *              z' = x' - I'
 *              z = z'     if o is even
 *                = z' - 1 if o is odd
 *              y = z*(pi/4)
 *
 * Note that z' is in fact the fraction bits of the quotient x'/(pi/4) =
 * (x + n*(pi/4))/(pi/4) = x/(p/4) + n, so that the reduction process can be
 * described by
 *
 *              o  = low three integer bits of [x/(pi/4) + n ]
 *              z' = fractional bits of (x/(pi/4))
 *              z = z'     if o is even                         (1)
 *                = z' - 1 if o is odd
 *              y = z*(pi/4)
 *
 * We see that the key operation is to compute x/(pi/4).  With this
 * in mind, let x = 2^n*f, where 2^v <= f < 2^(v+1) and f has P significant
 * bits.  If F is defined as F = 2^(P-v-1)*f, it follows that F is an integer.
 * Now
 *
 *              x/(pi/4) = x *(4/pi)
 *                       = (2^n*f) *(4/pi)
 *                       = [2^(n-P+v+1)]*[2^(P-v-1)*f] *(4/pi)
 *                       = [2^(n-P+v+1)]*F*(4/pi)
 *                       = F*{[2^(n-P+v+1)]*(4/pi)}
 *
 * Suppose that we have stored a large bit string that represents the value
 * of 4/pi, then we can obtain the value of 2^(n-P+v+1)*(4/pi) by moving the
 * binary point in 4/pi by n-P+v+1 places.  In particular, let
 *
 *              2^(n-P+v+1)*(4/pi) = J*8 + g
 *
 * That is, J is an integer formed from the first n-P+v-2 bits of 4/pi and
 * g is value formed by the remaining bits.  It follows that 
 *
 *              x/(pi/4) = F*{[2^(n-P+v+1)]*(4/pi)}
 *                       = F*(J*8 + g)
 *                       = F*J*8 + F*g
 *
 * Note that (1) implies that we need only compute x/(pi/4) modulo 8.  Noting
 * that F and J are integer, the above gives
 *
 *              x/(pi/4) (mod 8) = (F*J*8 + F*g) (mod 8)
 *                               = F*g (mod 8)
 *
 * At this point the algorithm for large argument reduction has the following
 * flavor:
 *
 *              (1) index into a precomputed bit string for 4/pi to
 *                  obtain g 
 *              (2) compute w = F*g (mod 8)
 *              (3) o <-- integer part of w + n
 *              (4) z' <-- fractional part of w
 *              (5) z = z'     if o is even
 *                    = z' - 1 if o is odd
 *              (6) y = z*(pi/4)
 *
 *			Algorithm I
 *			-----------
 *
 * The following sections describe the implementation issues associated with
 * each of the steps in algorithm I as well as present the code for the 
 * overall implementation.
 *
 *
 * THE 4/pi TABLE
 * --------------
 *
 * Step (1) of Algorithm I requires indexing into a bit string for 4/pi using
 * the exponent field of the argument.  Specifically, if n is the argument
 * exponent we want to shift the binary point of 4/pi by n - (P - v - 1) bits
 * to the right.  Since x can be as small as 1, it is possible that n - (P -
 * v - 1) is negative.  Thus to facilitate the indexing operation, it is
 * necessary for the bit string to have some leading 0's.
 *
 * Assume the bit string for 4/pi has T leading zeros and that the bits are
 * numbered in increasing order starting from 0.  I.e. the string looks like:
 *
 *	bit number: 0      T
 *	            00...001.01000101111.....
 *                          ^
 *                          |
 *		       binary point 
 *
 * From the above discussion, we want to shift the binary point of the bit
 * string P-v-1 bits to the right and extract g as some (as yet undetermined)
 * number of bits, starting o bits to the left of the shifted binary point.
 * Consequently, the position of the most significant bit we would like to
 * access is k = (T - 1) + [n - (P - v - 1)] - o = T + n - P + v - o.  Since
 * we want the bit position to be greater than or equal to zero, and we are
 * assuming that the argument is greater than or equal to 1 (i.e. n >= -v),
 * it follows that T >= P + o.  Since 4/pi is stored as bit string, it is
 * data type independent.  Consequently, the same table can be used for all
 * supported data types.  This means that the value of P used to determine T
 * should represent the largest precision supported.

/*
 * Since most architectures do not efficiently support bit addressing, the
 * argument reduction routine assumes that the 4/pi bit string is stored
 * in L-bit "digits", where L will be specified later.  Getting the right bits
 * of 4/pi requires getting the set of "digits" that begin with the digit that
 * contains the leading bit and doing a sequence of shifts and logical ors.
 * The index of the digit that contains the initial bit is trunc(n/L) and the
 * bit position within that digit is n - L*trunc(n/L) = n % L. On some
 * architectures, obtaining both the quotient and remainder of an integer
 * division is faster than obtaining each one separately.  Consequently we
 * assume the existence of a div_rem operator.
 *
 * If the 4/pi table has been created, pick up the DIGIT definition from there

 * The last issue associated with the 4/pi table is how many bits of 4/pi

 * of the argument less the number of bits of precision, the maximum number of
 * bits that can be skipped over is
 *
 *		MAX_EXP + (1 + v - P)
 *
 * Further, we require that the result be accurate to P + k bits, so that

 * COMPUTING F*g
 * -------------
 *
 * The goal of step (2) in Algorithm I is to produce a reduced argument that
 * is accurate to P + k bits, where k is minimum overhang in the polynominal
 * evaluation of the trig function.  Also, we need to get the octant bits, o.
 * Consequently, the value of w = F*g, must be accurately computed to P + k + 3
 * bits.  Note however, that if x is close to a multiple of pi/2 the reduced
 * argument will have a large number of leading zeros (in fixed point) and
 * consequently the actual number of required bits in w will depend upon the
 * input argument.  Since computing w is the most time consuming part of the
 * algorithm, we would like to compute the minimum number of bits possible.
 * Specifically, compute w to enough bits so that if x is not near a multiple
 * of pi/2, then the reduced argument will be accurate.  After w is computed,
 * we can check how close the original argument was to pi/2 by examining
 * the number of leading fractional 1's or 0's in w.  If there are too many
 * (i.e. the reduced argument will not have enough significant bits) then we
 * can compute additional bits of w.
 *
 * In order to compute F*g to P + k + 3 bits, we must perform some form of 
 * extended precision arithmetic.  For the sake of uniformity across data
 * types and architectures, the implementation described here computes F*g by
 * expressing F and g as fixed point values in "arrays" of some basic integer
 * unit of computation.  As indicated above, we shall refer to this integer
 * unit as a digit.  The choice of digit is arbitrary, however, it is best if
 * the double length product of two digits is efficiently computed.
 *
 * Now we need to represent w to at least P + k + o bits.  Since F has P

 *
 * The high two digits of the product are not required since we are interested
 * in the result modulo 8.
 *
 * In general the number of digits used to express g' will contain more
 * than N bits.  Let the number of bits in excess of N be M.  Then if x is
 * close to pi/2 and the number of leading fractional 0's or 1's in F*g' is
 * less than M, F*g' still contains enough significant bits to return an
 * accurate reduced argument.  Note that x will be close to pi/2 if o is
 * odd and z' has leading 1's or o is even and z' has leading 0's.  Note
 * further that the octant bits will be the high order 3 bits of one of the
 * most significant digit of the product.   Therefore there will be loss
 * of significance if w1 (in the picture above) has a binary representation
 * of the form
 *
 *                      +----------------------+
 *                      |xx00000...00000xxxxxxx|
 *                      +----------------------+
 *                              - or -
 *                      +----------------------+
 *                      |xx11111...11111xxxxxxx|
 *                      +----------------------+
 *                         |<-- M+2 -->|
 *
 * These two bit patterns can be detected by add and mask operations.
 *
 * Assuming that M+2 0's or 1's appear in w1, we know that there are not
 * enough significant bits in w to guarantee the accuracy of the answer.
 * Consequently, we need to generate more bits of w.  This can be done by
 * getting the next digit of g, computing the product of that digit with
 * F and adding it into the previous value of w.  This process can be repeated
 * until there are a sufficient number of significant bits.  Note that each
 * additional digit of g will add one digit (L bits) of significance to w.
 *
 * If the processes of adding additional significant bits is implemented in a
 * naive fashion, each time through the loop will require an additional digit
 * of storage.  Consider the situation where the first addition digit has
 * been added to w and there are still insufficient significant bits for
 * an accurate result.  This means that there are at least M + L leading
 * fractional 0's or 1's.  Then w must have the form
 *
 *              |<------------ D + 1 digits ---------->|
 *              +----------+----------+     +----------+
 *              |xx########|######xxxx| ... |xxxxxxxxxx|
 *              +----------+----------+     +----------+
 *                 |<-- M+L+2 -->|
 *
 * where the #'s indicate a string of 0's or 1's.  Since there are more than
 * L consecutive 0's or 1's, we can compress the representation of w by one
 * digit by removing L consecutive 0's or 1's from the first two digits
 * of w.  If this is done w will look like
 *
 *              |<-------------- D digits ------------>|
 *              +----------+----------+     +----------+
 *              |xx#####xxx|xxxxxxxxxx| ... |xxxxxxxxxx|
 *              +----------+----------+     +----------+
 *              -->|M+2|<--
 *
 * Which is the same as for when the first additional digit was added.
 * It follows that we need storage for only D+1 digits of w and a counter
 * indicating the number of additional digits that were added.
 *
 * To recap the above discussion, algorithm I is expanded as follows:
 *
 *               (1) s <-- 0
 *               (2) w <-- first D digits of F*g
 *               (3) if w has less than or equal to M leading fractional
 *                   0's or 1's, go to step 9
 *               (4) add an additional digit of F*g to w
 *               (5) if w has less than L leading leading fractional 0's
 *                   or 1's, go to step 9
 *               (6) Compact w by removing L 0's or 1's
 *               (7) s <-- s + 1
 *               (8) go to step 3.
 *               (9) o <-- integer part of w
 *              (10) z' <-- fractional part of w (taking into account what
 *		            ever compaction took place, i.e. what the current
 *			    value of s is.)
 *              (11) z = z'     if I is even
 *                   = z' - 1 if I is odd
 *              (12) y = z*(pi/4)
 *		
 *				Algorithm II
 *				------------
 *
 * The above loop has two exits.  An exit from step 3 yields an approximation
 * to w containing D digits while an exit from step 5 contains D+1 digits.
 * In the second case, there are fewer than L leading 0's and 1's and this
 * implies that there are enough "good" bits in the first D digits to generate
 * the return values.  Consequently, from either exit, it is sufficient to
 * use only the first D digits of w.
 *
 * The exposition above on the number of leading zeros was a little loose, in
 * that the leading zeros and ones will not always lie entirely in the digit
 * of w.  In general, there can be as many as L-1 extra bits, in which case,
 * we need to examine both the first and second word of w.

 * The above algorithm for computing F*g contains a number of inefficiencies.
 * However, making the algorithm more efficient requires implementing
 * several special code paths to capitalize on specific conditions.  It was
 * felt that the efficiency gained by these special code paths did not warrant
 * the increase in code complexity.  For the sake of completeness however,
 * the possibilities are discussed here.
 *
 * First, the leading 0's and leading 1's cases are not symmetric.  Since
 * g' is obtain from g by truncation, adding more bits to w cannot increase
 * the number of leading 0's.  Consequently, if the initial cause for adding
 * more bits to w was due to leading 0's, one can predict a priori how many
 * additional digits to add to w.
 *
 * If, however, w initially had a string of leading 1's, than subsequent
 * digits of w could bring in more 1's, so determining how many additional
 * digits to process is an iterative procedure.  Also, it is possible that
 * computing additional digits of w will cause a leading 1's string to be
 * turned into a leading 0's string.
 *
 * Second, for any pass through the loop it's possible there are L+1 leading
 * 0's or 1's, but there are still sufficient significant  bits for the result.
 * In this case, the compaction and additional test could be avoided. 
 * (However, this will complicate the cycles to radian conversion.  See below)
 *
 * By way of putting these inefficiencies into perspective, for VAX f and g
 * format or IEEE s and t format, using a 32 bit digit, the initial
 * approximation to w contains 7 and 13 extra bits for single and double
 * precision respectively.  That means on a random basis, the loop is entered
 * less that 1% of the time in single precision and less than 1/100% of the
 * time in double.

/*
 * DIGIT ARITHMETIC
 * ----------------
 *
 * In step (2) of Algorithm 2, we are computing the first D digits of the
 * product F*g.  From figure 1, we see that, (in general) we are computing
 * a 2*L bit product and incorporating it into the sum of previously computed
 * 2*L bit products.  If we think of F, g and w as multi-digit integers with
 * their digits numbered from least significant to most significant (starting
 * at zero) and denoting the i-th digit of F by F(i) and the j-th digit of
 * g by g(j), then the product in figure 1 can be obtained as follows:

 *	t = 0;
 *	for (i = 0; i < num_g_digits; i++) {
 *	    for (j = 0; j < num_F_digits; j++)
 *	        t = t + F[j]*g[i]*2^(j*L)
 *	    w[i] = t mod 2^L;
 *	    t = (t >> L);            
 *	}
 *
 *			      Example 1
 *			      ---------
 *
 * Note that each time through the loop, t is accumulating the product g[i]*F
 * plus "the high digits" of g[i-1]*F.  It follows that t can be represented
 * in (num_F_digits + 1) digits.
 *
 * If F contains n digits, then the sum in the above loops looks like:
 *
 *	+--------+     +--------+--------+--------+--------+     +--------+ 
 *   t: |  t(n)  | ... | t(j+3) | t(j+2) | t(j+1) |  t(j)  | ... |  t(0)  |

 *	+--------+     +--------+--------+--------+--------+     +--------+ 
 *
 * Note that t(0) through t(j-1) are unaffected and that t(j+2) through
 * t(n) are affected only by the carry out when computing t'(j+1).  It
 * follows that if we keep the carry out of t'(j+1) as a separate quantity,
 * then the addition in the inner loop only affects two digits of t.  If
 * we denote the separate carry by c(j), the picture on the next iteration of

 *	+--------+     +--------+--------+--------+--------+     +--------+

 * The above gives rise to the notion of a multiply/add primitive that has 5
 * inputs and 3 output: 
 *
 *	Inputs:		N, M	the most and least significant digits
 *				of t that are being added to
 *			C	the carry out from the previous mul/add
 *			A, B	The two digits that are to be multiplied
 *
 *	Outputs:	C'	The carry out of the final sum
 *			N',M'	The updated values of N and M.
 *
 * Recalling that the number of bits per digit is denoted by L, the mul/add
 * primitive is algebraicly defined by:
 *
 *		s  <-- (N + C)*2^L + A*B
 *		M' <-- s % 2^L
 *		N' <-- floor(s/2^L) % 2^L
 *		C' <-- floor(s/2^(2*L)) % 2^L
 *
 * Note that in example 1, there are several special cases of the mul/add
 * macro which might be faster depending on the values of i and j:
 *
 *	   i and j			Special case
 *	------------------	---------------------------------
 *	1) i = 0, j = 0		N = M = C = 0, C' = 0
 *	2) i = 0, j < n-1	N = C = 0, C' = 0
 *	3) i = 0, j = n-1	N = C = 0, C' = 0 and N' not needed
 *
 *	4) i > 0, j = 0		C = 0	
 *	5) i > 0, j < n-1	general case
 *	6) i > 0, j = n-1	N = 0, C' not needed
 *
 *	7) i + j = n-2		C' not needed
 *	8) i + j = n-1		C, N, C' and N' not needed
 *		
 * Note that cases 3 and 7 are functionally identical.  For purposes of this
 * discussion we will use the mnemonic XMUL to refer to producing a 2*L-bit
 * product from 2 L-bit digits and XADD/XADDC to refer to the addition of one 
 * 2*L-bit integer to another without/with producing a carry out.  With this
 * naming convention we denote the following 6 mul/add operations that
 * correspond to the 6 special cases as follows:
 *
 *	case	mul/add operator name
 *	----	---------------------
 *	 1)	 XMUL(A,B, N',M')
 *	 2)	 XMUL_ADD(A,B,M,N',M')
 *	 3)	 MUL_ADD(A,B,M,M')
 *	 4)	 XMUL_XADDC(A,B,N,M,C',N',M')
 *	 5)	 XMUL_XADDC_W_C_IN(C,A,B,N,M,C',N',M')
 *	 6)	 XMUL_XADD_W_C_IN(N,M,C,A,B,C',N',M')
 *
 * [XMUL_XADD_W_C_IN is described with more parameters than are actually used.]
 * [There are 8 cases, two of which are "functionally identical".  That leaves
 *  7 cases, but only 6 have a "mul/add operator name".]

/*
 * CONVERTING W TO FLOATING POINT
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * In converting w to floating point, we have to convert one digit at a
 * time in something like a Horner's scheme polynomial evaluation.
 *
 *      floating_w = S*S2*(w1 + S1*(w2 + S1*(w3 + S1*w4)))
 *
 * where S1 is 1/2^L and S2 = 1/2^(L-o) and S is the scale factor required
 * to compensate for the compaction of w during the looping phase.
 *
 * In addition to converting w to floating point format, we want to convert
 * from cycles to radians.  This involves multiplying by pi/4.  Thus the
 * reduced argument looks something like
 *
 *      reduced_arg = (pi/4)*S*S2*(w1 + S1*(w2 + S1*(w3 + S1*w4)))
 *
 * Since S2 and pi/4 are compile time constants, we can combine them and
 * eliminate one multiply.  Thus
 *
 *      reduced_arg = (S2*pi/4)*S*(w1 + S1*(w2 + S1*(w3 ... S1*wn)))    (2)
 *
 * Finally, note that S and S2 will be powers of two, so that the multiply
 * can be done either by adjusting the exponent or by multiplication.
 *
 * Recall that we would like to return the reduced argument with at least k
 * extra bits.  If there is a back-up data type, then the reduced argument
 * can be returned in that data type and equation (2) can be applied directly.
 * If there is no back-up data type, then both the conversion to floating
 * point and the conversion to radians must be carried out with some care
 * in the base precision.  Specifically the approach we will take will be to
 * break the floating point value of w and pi/4 into hi and lo pieces and
 * compute the reduced argument as
 *
 *              reduced_arg = (pi/4)*w
 *                          = (pi_ov_4_hi + pi_ov_4_lo)*(w_hi + w_lo)
 *                          = pi_ov_4_hi*w_hi + (pi_ov_4_lo*w_hi +
 *                               pi_ov_4_hi*w_lo + pi_ov_4_lo*w_lo)
 *                          = pi_ov_4_hi*w_hi + (pi_ov_4_lo*w_hi + pi_ov_4*w)
 *                          = r1 + r2
 *
 * where pi_over_4_hi and w_hi are chosen so that r1 is exact.  Having obtained
 * r1 and r2, we compute the high p bits of the reduced argument, r_hi, and the
 * remaining low bits, r_lo, as
 *
 *              r_hi = r1 + r2,         r_lo = r2 - (r_hi - r1)
 *
 * Recall from the description above, that at the point where the conversion to 
 * floating point takes place, w has less than L leading 0's or 1's.  If the
 * digit size and precision have the "right" relationship, it is relatively
 * easy to determine a short sequence of int ==> float converts that implement
 * the above algorithm.  However, if the digit size is small, since the number
 * of leading zeros is not known at compile time, the necessary sequence of 
 * conversions can be complicated.  To alleviate this complication, we will
 * normalize the bits of w.  This costs a little in performance in the case
 * where there is backup precision, but it greatly enhances portability.  The
 * normalization we will use has the "octant" bits in the high 3 bits of the
 * msd of w.  Assuming this normalization, the first n digits of w will
 * contain n*L - o good bits.  Since we want p + k good bits in the final
 * result, it follows that n = ceil(p+k+o).
