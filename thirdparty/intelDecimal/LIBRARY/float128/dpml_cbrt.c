/*
 *  The algorithms used for the cbrt function are detailed in the X_FLOAT_NOTES
 *  file (notes 18.*).
 *
 *  The basic approach is to factor the input x into f * 2^n, where 
 *  1 <= f < 2  and  n = 3*m + i, where i = 0, 1, or 2.  Then 
 *
 *    cbrt(x) = cbrt(2^n * f)
 *            = cbrt(2^(3*m+i) * f)
 *            = 2^m * cbrt(2^i) * cbrt(f).
 *
 *  To get cbrt(f), we do a poly approx y = P(f), and then enough Newton's
 *  iterations to get the required accuracy.  We fetch 2^(i/3) from a table
 *  and multiply the result; then add m to the final exponent and adjust the
 *  final sign.
 *
 *  The generated file contains the poly coefficients and a small table of
 *  the roots, 2^(i/3), in full double precision and in lo parts  (the short
 *  hi part can be computed when the code executes).
 *  The generated file also contains a few other constants, and some #defines.
 *
 *  An optimization: instead of fetching 2^(i/3) as a floating point number
 *  and multiplying right away, we can fetch it into an integer register;
 *  add (sign + m) to its sign/exponent field;  and then move
 *  it to a floating point register.  On pipelined machines, this integer
 *  manipulation is done in parallel with the polynomial and/or Newton's
 *  iteration, so has "zero cost".  On sequential machines, these steps 
 *  have to be done at some point in time anyway.
 *
 *
 *  Single precision is implemented by computing a 9th degree double precision
 *  poly approx of cbrt(f).  The poly is good to about 30 bits, so we don't
 *  need any Newton's iterations.  We fetch the full-precision double 
 *  precision floating point number 2^(i/3) from the table, put it in an 
 *  integer variable, adjust its exponent and sign, move it to a floating
 *  point variable, multiply times the poly approx, and round back to
 *  single precision.
 *
 *
 *  Double and quad precision need to do Newton's iteration(s) after the 
 *  poly approx.  There are many choices of Newton's iterations for cbrt,
 *  with varying convergence.  Three interesting candidates with cubic 
 *  convergence are:
 *
 *  A:   y' =  y  -  (y/2) * (y^3 - f)            where y = P(f) ~ f^(1/3)
 *                           ---------
 *                          (y^3 + f/2)
 *
 *
 *  B:   y' =  y  -  f * z^3 * (y^3 - f) * (z*f + 7*y - 5* z^2 * y^2 *f) * 1/9
 *
 *           where y = P(f) ~ f^(1/3)  and  z = Q(f) ~ f^(-2/3)
 *
 *
 *  C:   y' =  z * f * (14 -  7 * z^3 * f^2  +  2 * z^6 * f^4 ) * 1/9
 *
 *           where y  ~ f^(1/3)  and  z ~ f^(-2/3)  as above.
 *
 *  
 *  The first Newton's iteration (A) comes from  y' =  y -  f(y)/f'(y),
 *  where f(y) = y^2 - x/y  maps out the curve   y^3 = x.  It has cubic
 *  convergence: the number of "good" bits in y' is 3*n, where 
 *  n = number of "good" bits we started with.  The initial approximation
 *  y = P(f)  approximates  f^(1/3).  The numerator  y^3 - f  can suffer
 *  massive cancellation error;  we'd have to compute it in extra precision.
 *
 *  The second Newton's iteration (B) is a variation on A.  It has the same
 *  "residual" y^3 - f, and has some extra factors that force the convergence
 *  to be cubic  (replace y with y*(1 + eps);  the rapidity of convergence
 *  depends on which powers of eps drop out).  In this case the number of
 *  "good" bits in y' is 3*n - 2.  This form of Newton's iteration needs two
 *  initial approximations:  y = P(f)  approximating f^(1/3)  and 
 *  z = Q(f) approximating f^(-2/3)  -  but we can get y from z by multiplying
 *  z * f.
 *
 *  The third Newton's iteration (C) is also a variation on A.  It has cubic
 *  convergence.  It has no divide, and also has no "residual".  The error
 *  is not small enough to use for double precision, but it is sufficient for
 *  a quick (40 bit) approximation for quad precision.
 *  
 *
 *  All three Newton's iterations have to be scaled by 2^(i/3).  We compute
 *  the residual y^3 - f in A and B very carefully to avoid cancellation:
 *    shorten y so that y*y is exact and a little short
 *    split the shortened y into hi and lo parts so that (y*y)*y_hi is
 *          also exact;
 *    y approximates f^1/3, so  (y*y)*y_hi - f is exact;
 *    then the residual
 *           y^3 - f ~  ((y*y)*y_hi - f) - (y*y)*y_lo
 *  Since C doesn't use the residual, there's no need to shorten or split y.
 *
 *  The first Newton's iteration has a divide, which is slow on Alpha (but
 *  not too bad in X_FLOAT).  The second Newton's iteration has no divide;
 *  it does have more arithmetic operations, which can be pipelined;
 *  furthermore, it requires two initial poly approximations, but we can avoid
 *  one of them by using y = f * z.  The third Newton's iteration is the
 *  fastest but least accurate.
 *
 *
 *  For double precision code, we use the second Newton's iteration, slightly 
 *  altered to maximize pipelining and to minimize cancellation; thus avoiding
 *  double precision floating divide.
 *
 *  We start with a degree 8 poly approx for z, to get 23 bits, and then
 *  compute y = f * z.  We shorten y to NUM_Y_BITS by masking out the
 *  low 32 bits  (n = 21).  Then split y into y_hi and y_lo, by masking out
 *  the low bits in the shortened y.
 *
 *  Let t = y * y.  t is exact and has NUM_Y_HI_BITS trailing zeros.  
 *  Then y^3 = t * y_hi  +  t * y_lo  is an extended precision quantity
 *  with NUM_Y_HI_BITS extra bits.  The first term has no roundoff error.
 *  We compute the residual as the sum of the exact first part and a 
 *  second part which is not exact but is small:
 *
 *      y^3 - f    =   (t * y_hi - f) + t * y_lo
 *
 *  There's a tradeoff here:  the shorter y is (n bits), the smaller
 *  the number of bits we get from the Newton's iteration  3*n - 2.
 *  We definitely want 3*n - 2 to be larger than F_PRECISION.  But the shorter
 *  y is, the more bits we can get in y_hi, and the more extra precision we
 *  get.  We definitely want n < F_PRECISION/2.  Another consideration is
 *  the accuracy of the initial approximation, which gives us the n "good" 
 *  bits to begin with:  z had only 23 bits, so y really has only 22.
 *
 *  Let n = NUM_Y_BITS = 21.  y_hi has D_PRECISION - 2 * n = 11 bits.  
 *  The Newton's iteration gives 3*n - 2 = 61 bits, which gives us a double
 *  precision cbrt with excellent error characteristics.
 *
 *  We have to scale up the Newton's iteration by 2^m * 2^(i/3).
 *  To do the scaling, let c_full and c_lo be the full precision and the lo 
 *  parts of 2^(i/3).  c_hi is computed = c_full - c_lo; c_lo is chosen so
 *  that c_hi is short and y * c_hi is exact.  Then the Newton's iteration
 *  including scaling is computed as
 *
 *    y'  =  y * (c_full - c_lo) +  
 *
 *            ( y * c_lo  + 
 *
 *                ((f - t*y_hi) - t*y_lo) *
 *                    ( (c_full * (7/9 * (f*z)*(z*z)))  * 
 *                                 (1/7 * (z*f) +  y + (z*z)*(5/7 * f)*t)) )
 *
 *  The Newton's iteration takes about 8 chimes after z (poly) is finished.
 *
 *
 *
 *  To do quad precision, since each X_FLOAT floating point operation is so
 *  slow, we do an initial approximation in double precision, convert the
 *  results to quad, and then do a quad precision Newton's iteration.
 *  We postpone adding m to the exponent until the last quad precision 
 *  operation; this simplifies the earlier steps.
 *
 *  Rather than actually calling double precision cbrt(), we cast f to 
 *  double precision df and compute a simplified double precision cbrt 
 *  approximation in-line.  We know 1 <= df < 2, so no need to normalize df 
 *  or process the exponent.  We start with a poly, then do the third
 *  Newton's iteration (C).  We scale times 2^(i/3) by loading the full 
 *  precision c_full into a double precision floating point register and doing
 *  a floating multiply.  Then split the double precision result dy into
 *  dy_hi and dy_lo, and convert all three to quad.
 *
 *  The cost of the double precision cbrt approx is probably comparable to
 *  one quad precision floating point operation.
 *
 *  After dy, dy_hi and dy_lo have been converted to y, y_hi, and y_lo, we
 *  need to do a Newton's iteration.  Each quad precision floating point 
 *  operation is costly, but a divide is relatively less than for double
 *  precision.  Therefore we use the first proposed Newton iteration, in
 *  the following decomposition:   t = y * y
 *
 *      y' =  y  -  y * (( t * y_hi - f) + t * y_lo)
 *                      ----------------------------
 *                        (t*y + t*y) + f
 *
 *  This requires 5 multiplies, 5 adds and 1 divide. We have to scale f 
 *  by 2^i, by adding i to the exponent.  Finally, add (sign + m) to the 
 *  sign/exponent field.
 *
 *
 *  The accuracy for all 3 precisions is quite satisfactory, just a little
 *  over .5 lsb.  The performance is more than twice as fast as the routines
 *  they replace.
