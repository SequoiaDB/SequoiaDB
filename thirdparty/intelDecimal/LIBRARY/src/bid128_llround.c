  DESCRIPTION:
    The llround function rounds its argument to the nearest integer value of
    type long int, using rounding to nearest-away 
  RETURN VALUE: 
    If the rounded value is outside the range of the return type or the 
    argument is infinity or NaN, the result is the largest negative value
    and the invalid exception is signaled
  EXCEPTIONS SIGNALED: 
    invalid
