Note: 000, 001, ..., 111 are associated with the following three conditions:

bit 2 [msb]: 0 = call by value (except for the pointer to the status flags, 
                 passed by reference unless global)
             1 = call by reference;
bit 1      : 0 = rounding mode passed as a parameter
             1 = rounding mode passed in global variable _IDEC_glbround 
                 (fixed name)
bit 0 [lsb]: 0 = pointer to status flags passed as a parameter
             1 = status flags passed in global variable _IDEC_glbflags 
                 (fixed name)

Example (one of eight possible, for Linux only; similar for other OS-es):

Build libbid.a in ../LIBRARY with '...CALL_BY_REF=0 GLOBAL_RND=0 GLOBAL_FLAGS=0'
$ cp main.c_000 main.c
$ cp decimal.h_000 decimal.h
$ icc main.c ../LIBRARY/libbid.a
$ ./a.out 
Begin Decimal Floating-Point Sanity Check
TEST CASE 1 FOR bid128_mul 000 () PASSED
TEST CASE 2 FOR bid128_mul 000 () PASSED
TEST CASE 3 FOR bid128_mul 000 () PASSED
End Decimal Floating-Point Sanity Check
$ rm main.c decimal.h a.out

    Note: The scripts and makefiles provided here may need adjustments, 
        depending on the environment in which they are used; for example if 
        moving files from Windows to Linux, running dos2unix on the Linux 
        script files may be necessary.

Note: For some other operating systems and architecture combinations see the 
  following command files, as well as any command files invoked from these ones:
	RUNLINUX
	RUNWINDOWS.bat
	RUNWINDOWSINTEL64.bat (for IA-64 Architecture)
	RUNOSX
	RUNOSXINTEL64 (for IA-64 Architecture)
	RUNSOLARIS
        RUNHPUX32 (for HP-UX* on IA-64 Architecture, 32-bit data mode)
        RUNHPUX64 (for HP-UX* on IA-64 Architecture, 64-bit data mode)
  These command files build and run all eight examples from this directory,
  possibly using more than one compiler. Changes may be needed for certain
  environments. However, prior to building these examples the similar RUN*
  command has to be executed in ../LIBRARY/ in order to build all the
  necessary versions of the Intel(R) Decimal Floating-Point Math Library
  V2.2 (Version 2, Update 2).
  The tests [when built correctly] pass if the word FAIL does not appear in
  the output.

  If the MS compiler earlier than VS2005 is used, the following line
     call windowsbuild.bat
  should be replaced with the following line in RUNWINDOWSINTEL64.bat
     call windowsbuild.bat bufferoverflowU.lib
