/*! @page tune_zone_reclaim Linux zone reclamation memory management

The performance of WiredTiger applications can be sensitive to the zone
reclamation algorithms used in Linux Non Uniform Memory Management (NUMA).
Details of NUMA with specific reference to Linux can be found in the
ACM Queue article
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2513149">
NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access): An Overview</a>, by Christoph Lameter.
If a WiredTiger database cache is assigned a significant proportion of
system memory, it will likely be beneficial to disable zone reclamation.
Zone reclamation can be disabled by running the following command as the
root user:

@code
echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode
@endcode
