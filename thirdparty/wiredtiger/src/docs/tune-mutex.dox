/*! @page tune_mutex Mutexes

The performance of WiredTiger applications can be sensitive to type of
mutex used for serialization.  WiredTiger can be configured, using the
\c --with-spinlock argument during configuration to use one of three
different mutex types: \c gcc, \c pthread and \c pthread_adaptive mutexes.

The \c gcc option configures GCC compiler (or compatible compilers such
as clang), mutexes; the \c pthread option configures POSIX 1003.1c
pthread mutexes; the \c pthread_adaptive option configures POSIX 1003.1c
pthread mutexes with adaptive behavior (where that behavior is
supported, for example, most Linux platforms).

By default, WiredTiger is configured to use \c pthread, that is,
non-adaptive POSIX 1003.1c pthread mutexes.
