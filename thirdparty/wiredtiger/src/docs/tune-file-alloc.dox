@section tuning_system_file_block_grow File growth

It's faster on some filesystems to grow a file in chunks rather than to
extend it a block at a time as new blocks are written.  By configuring
the wiredtiger_open functions \c file_extend value, applications can
grow files ahead of the blocks being written.

@snippet ex_all.c Configure file_extend

The system calls used to extend files in chunks on some systems require
locking across the system call, which may decrease performance.  Before
configuring a \c file_extend value, before and after throughput should
be carefully evaluated.

@section tuning_system_file_block_allocation File block allocation

By default, when file blocks are being reused, WiredTiger attempts to
avoid file fragmentation by selecting the smallest available block
rather than splitting a larger available block into two.  The \c
block_allocation configuration string to WT_SESSION::create can be set
to \c first to change the algorithm to first-fit, that is, take the
first available block in the file.  Applications where file size is more
of an issue than file fragmentation (for example, applications with
fixed-size blocks) might want to configure this way.

@snippet ex_all.c Configure block_allocation
