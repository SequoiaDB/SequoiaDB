# Spark-SequoiaDB connector

Spark-SequoiaDB connector is a library that allows users to read/write data with [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) from/into SequoiaDB collections.

[SequoiaDB](http://www.sequoiadb.com/ "SequoiaDB website") is a document-oriented NoSQL database and provides a JSON storage model. [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/ "Spark website") is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system.

Spark-SequoiaDB connector is used to integrate SequoiaDB and Spark, in order to give users a system that combines the advantages of schema-less storage model with dynamic indexing and Spark cluster.
