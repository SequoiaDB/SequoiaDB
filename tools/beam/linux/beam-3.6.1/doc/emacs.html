<h1 class="title">BEAM Emacs Macros - beam-parse.el</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
<h1>What is beam-parse.el?</h1>

</p>
<p>
      Beam's output can be difficult to work with sometimes. You need to
      load the right source files, look around for each warning or error,
      decide if it is a real error or something you want to mark as
      innocent, and then either write a comment in the source that
      beam understands or locate the innocents file and write an
      innocent code there.
</p>
<p>
      <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> is an emacs package
      that will make this process easier and quicker. Once loaded, it
      provides functions to examine the beam output, automatically
      load the proper source files, and jump straight to the
      errors. It also allows you to quickly mark errors as innocent by
      writing the innocent file (with an optional comment) or by
      writing the magic comment line straight in the source.
</p>
<p>
      <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> has been tested with GNU Emacs
      version 20.1 and higher, and XEmacs version 20.2 and higher.
      It may also work with other configurations.
</p>
<p>
<h1>How do I get started?</h1>

</p>
<p>
    <h2>Loading beam-parse.el</h2>

</p>
<p>
      In order to define the beam functions that you will use to
      navigate beam errors, you need to load
      <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> into emacs (or xemacs). You
      can do this one of two ways, depending on whether or not you
      want to load it every time you start emacs.
</p>
<p>
      If you want <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> to load with emacs every
      time you start emacs up, you need to load it in your emacs init
      file. Normally this is <span class="file">~/.emacs</span> or
      <span class="file">~/.xemacs/init.el</span>. Add these lines to that
      file to load <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> automatically:
</p>
<pre class="example">
; This loads beam-parse.el every time emacs is started.
; <span class="strong">Make sure</span> to change <span class="val">install_point</span> to the directory where
; beam-parse.el is located, like <span class="val">/opt/beam/2.1/etc</span>.

(setq load-path (cons &quot;<span class="val">install_point</span>&quot; load-path))
(require 'beam-parse)
</pre>
<p>

      If you don't want <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> loaded
      automatically, you can load it manually before you want to use
      it (it only needs to be loaded again if you exit emacs).
</p>
<pre class="example">
M-x load-file RET <span class="file">/path/to/beam-parse.el</span> RET
</pre>
<p>

      Note that it is <span class="strong">not</span> recommended that you load
      beam-parse.el in this manner. Some functionality, like the
      ability to display extended help, will not work unless
      beam-parse.el is loaded via the <span class="code">(require 'beam-parse)</span> above.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Setting up beam output</h2>

</p>
<p>
      Before you can do anything else with this package, you must load
      some beam output into emacs and tell <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span>
      which loaded file to look at. Once the beam output is loaded,
      run <span class="function">beam-parse-buffer</span>. You can do this by either typing
      it in as a command:
</p>
<pre class="example">
M-x beam-parse-buffer RET
</pre>
<p>

      Or, you can use the keystroke that is bound to that command. By
      default, it's:
</p>
<pre class="example">
C-c b p
</pre>
<p>

      Running this command on some beam output I have loaded produces
      a screen that looks like this:
</p>
<p>
    <center>
      <img src="images/emacs_parsed.png" />
    </center>
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Working with colors</h2>

</p>
<p>
      After a buffer is parsed by beam, it is colored. Each error that
      hasn't been visited is shown in red. Errors that have been
      visited show up in orange. Errors that have been marked
      'innocent' show up in green. Also, the current error you are on
      and it's corresponding line in a source file show up in
      blue.
</p>
<p>
      Some beam errors have path information associated with
      them. This is the case when the beam output has something like
      <span class="code">&quot;ONE POSSIBLE PATH LEADING TO THE ERROR&quot;</span> as a part
      of the error. If an error has this extra information, you can
      ask <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> to color the path in question
      yellow in the source file you are looking at. This might make it
      easier to understand why beam thinks there is really an error
      there.
</p>
<p>
      To "color a path", use <span class="function">beam-color-path</span>, or it's
      associated key-binding.
</p>
<p>
      Here is an emacs session looking at an error, with the path
      colored in the source file.
</p>
<p>
    <center>
      <img src="images/emacs_path.png" />
    </center>
</p>
<p>
      These colors are just the default colors; to change them, read
      up on customizing beam-parse.el below.
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Moving from one error to another</h2>

</p>
<p>
      Now that <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> has seen all of the errors,
      you can move between them freely. To go directly to an error,
      you can <span class="term">middle-click</span> on the line of the error in the beam
      output buffer (any line with a source file and line number at
      the  beginning of it). You can also move the cursor on that line 
      and press <span class="term">RET</span>.
</p>
<p>
      There are also convenience functions that let you move to the
      next error in sequence. If you are done looking at the current
      error, you can move to the next with
      <span class="function">beam-next-error</span>. You can also do more
      advanced things while moving to the next error, like marking the
      current one innocent before continuing on. This is explained
      below.
</p>
<p>
      If you are more interested in moving along the current error's
      path, rather than going to the next error, you can either
      middle-click on the line in the path that you want to look at,
      or you can use <span class="function">beam-next-line-error</span> to
      move to the next line that's listed in the path for the error.
</p>
<p>
      Once you move past the last error, no errors will be
      highlighted. Going forward one more error from here will bring
      you back to the beginning of the list; going backwards will
      bring you back to the end of the list. This is also the state
      you are initially in right after a call to
      <span class="function">beam-parse-buffer</span>.
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Marking errors as innocent</h2>

</p>
<p>
      While you are looking at an error, you might decide that in your
      circumstances that it's not really an error, and you don't want
      beam to report it anymore. This can be done by marking the error
      as innocent.
</p>
<p>
      There are a few ways to do this; the easiest is to use
      <span class="function">beam-mark-innocent-in-source</span>, which will
      place the magic beam comment (like <span class="code">/*uninitialized*/</span>)
      right in the source file. If beam sees this next time, it won't
      report the error.
</p>
<p>
      Once an error is marked innocent, the beam output buffer will
      show it in green so that you know you have already dealt with
      it.
</p>
<p>
      There are other ways of marking innocents - for example,
      <span class="function">beam-mark-innocent</span> will look for the beam
      data directory (set with <span class="option">--beam::data=</span>) and will
      write the innocent information there. This is useful if you
      don't have write access to the source, or if you just don't want
      to change it.
</p>
<p>
      There are variations on these, too - you can mark an error
      innocent and go to the next in one command, like
      <span class="function">beam-mark-innocent-and-next-error</span>, or
      <span class="function">beam-mark-innocent-in-source-and-next-error</span>. 
      See below for more.
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Reading the extended help</h2>

</p>
<p>
      As you move from one complaint to the next, you may not
      understand what BEAM is actually complaining about. Perhaps the
      wording of the complaint is difficult to understand in the
      current code context, or perhaps the code is written in such a
      way that BEAM is not accurately pointing out the exact problem
      or reasons behind the complaint.
</p>
<p>
      Using version <span class="strong">3.2</span> or higher of
      <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> will give you access to what we call
      <span class="term">extended help</span>. This extended help has been available on the
      beam web page for a while now, under
      <a href="builtin.html">Built-in Complaints</a>, but is just
      recently available to <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> users in a
      convenient manner.
</p>
<p>
      By enabling the extended help via
      <span class="code">(beam-extended-help)</span> (<span class="code">C-c b h</span> by
      default), a new window will appear and contain the same
      documentation that is available on the web. As you move from one
      complaint to the next, the extended help window will contain
      extra descriptions of the complaint you are on, as well as hints
      and helpful pointers that may help track down the problem.
</p>
<p>
      By running <span class="code">(beam-extended-help)</span> a second time, the
      window will disappear.
</p>
<p>
      Note that in order for <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> to find the
      beam installation (so it can read this extended help
      information), you must either load <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span>
      directly from the beam installation via <span class="code">(require
      'beam-parse)</span>, or you must set the emacs variable
      <span class="var">beam-install-dir</span> to point to the root of your beam
      installation, like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
;; If you do not load beam-parse.el via (require 'beam-parse)
;; directly from the beam installation, set this variable in
;; your .emacs file

(setq beam-install-dir &quot;/opt/beam/2.0&quot;)
</pre>
<p>

      Obviously, use your <span class="strong">real</span> beam install
      directory. Remember, if you use <span class="code">require</span> and emacs
      can find <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> from right within the
      install point, this step isn't necessary.
</p>
<p>
      Here is an emacs window with the extended help window
      open. Please note that the code in the image is not the code
      that originally created this complaint. Obviously the variable
      in the screen-shot is initialized.

<h1>Customizing beam-parse.el</h1>

</p>
<p>
    Once <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> is loaded, you can customize a few
    things about it. There are special variables that
    <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> looks at, and there's also the colors
    it uses and the key-bindings that can be set.
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Variables</h2>

</p>
<p>
    <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> looks at a few variables. Right now,
    these are the ones that are customizable:
</p>
<p>
  <table width="75%">
      <tr>
	<th width="20%">Variable Name</th>
	<th width="10%">Type</th>
	<th width="80%">What it does</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-innocent-suffix
	</td>
	<td>
	  string
	</td>
	<td>
	  This suffix will be appended to the innocents filename
	  before it is opened.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-error-suffix
	</td>
	<td>
	  string
	</td>
	<td>
	  This suffix will be appended to the errors filename before
	  it is opened.
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-install-dir
	</td>
	<td>
	  string
	</td>
	<td>
	    This variable can be used to allow
	    <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> to find the beam install point
	    so that it can read supporting files (like extended help).
</p>
<p>
	    If <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> is loaded via <span class="code">(require
            'beam-parse.el)</span> and emacs is finding
            <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> in your beam install point, then
            setting this variable is not necessary.
	</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
</p>
<p>
    To customize these, put something like this in your emacs init file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(setq beam-error-suffix &quot;.errors&quot;)
</pre>
<p>

  <h2>Faces and Colors</h2>

</p>
<p>
    The colors that <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> uses are simple emacs
    faces. To customize emacs faces, you should use the emacs built-in
    editor. To activate it, use the menu:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      (In Emacs): "Options -> Customize Emacs -> Specific Face"
    </li>
    <li>
      (In XEmacs): "Options -> Edit Faces..."
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Or, use the command (this works in Emacs and XEmacs):
</p>
<pre class="example">
M-x customize-face RET RET
</pre>
<p>

    From this editor, you can change all aspects of the different beam
    "faces" - their colors, fonts, bold, underline, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Here are the current faces that beam uses:
</p>
<p>
  <table width="75%">
      <tr>
	<th width="25%">Face Name</th>
	<th width="75%">Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-error-face
	</td>
	<td>
	  Used to highlight errors that have not been visited in the
	  beam error buffer
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

	  error buffer
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-path-face

	  Used to highlight a path in the source code that the beam
	  error is valid for
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-innocent-face
	</td>
	<td>
	  Used to highlight errors that have been marked as innocent
	  in the beam error buffer
	</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>
	  beam-highlight-face
	</td>
	<td>

	  and the source file
	</td>

	<td>
	  beam-hover-face
	</td>
	<td>
	  Used to highlight an error as the mouse passes over it
	</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Key-bindings</h2>

</p>
<p>
    <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> sets up some default
    key-bindings. They all start with <span class="code">C-c b</span>, for
    "<span class="strong">B</span>eam". Here is a list of the default ones that are
    set. Note that if you already have one of these keys bound to
    something else, <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> will *not* change it on
    you. So, this table is only valid of the key-binding is not set
    when <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> was loaded.
</p>
<p>
  <table width="75%">
      <tr>

    <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> also overrides <span class="code">C-x `</span>
    (Control-X backtick). This is set up by emacs to go to the next
    compiler error. <span class="file">beam-parse.el</span> overrides this so that
    if there is a current parsed beam output buffer, it will act just
    like <span class="function">beam-next-error</span>, and if there isn't a beam
    parsed buffer, it will act just like it normally does.
