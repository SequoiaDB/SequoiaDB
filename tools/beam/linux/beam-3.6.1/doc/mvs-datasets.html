<h1 class="title">Support for MVS Dataset Header Files</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
BEAM on USS supports the use of MVS datasets as include files and
in include search paths. If your project makes use of header files
that are stored in datasets, here is a brief description of what you
have to do to include them. This information is not specific to BEAM
as BEAM seeks only to emulate the behavior of the compilers
available on USS and so the method of including dataset headers
should be identical.
</p>
<p>
First, whether you are including a dataset header in the source code
or passing a partitioned dataset (PDS) on the command line as an
include directory, you must enclose the name in single quotes and
prepend two forward slashes. On the command line you will need
to enclose the name in an additional set of double quotes to prevent 
the shell from consuming the single quotes. PDS member names should be in
parentheses following the PDS name. So, for example, if you have a PDS
named BEAM.INCLUDE.H with a member dataset named UTIL, and you want
to include it in your source file, then you need to write:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#include &lt;//'BEAM.INCLUDE.H(UTIL)'&gt;
</pre>
<p>

Alternatively, you can just include the member name in the source code:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#include &lt;UTIL&gt;
</pre>
<p>

And then pass the PDS name on the command line as an include directory:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cc -I&quot;//'BEAM.INCLUDE.H'&quot;
</pre>
<p>

The MVS file system is case insensitive, so the case of dataset names
used in source code generally should not matter. Also, everything after 
and including the first period in the include file name will be stripped 
before searching for a corresponding dataset, so all of the following 
would also work for the above example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#include &lt;util&gt;
#include &lt;util.h&gt;
#include &lt;util.nonsense.gibberish&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<h1>Details of the wildcard syntax for including PDSs</h1>

</p>
<p>
In addition to the regular syntax for adding a PDS to the include path, you
can use a sort of wildcard notation consisting of a PDS base followed by ".+"
as in -I"//'SYNLIB.BEAM.+'". If this syntax is used, directories preceding
the included file get appended as qualifiers to the PDS base, then suffixes
following the included file get appended, and finally the base file name is
used as the member name. Examples will clarify (hopefully). All of the 
following combinations of include directives and PDS names passed as
include directories on the command lines will translate to
//'SYNLIB.BEAM.INCLUDE.H(FOO)':
</p>
<pre class="example">
#include &lt;h/foo&gt;
cc -I &quot;//'SYNLIB.BEAM.INCLUDE.+'&quot;

#include &lt;foo.h&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.BEAM.INCLUDE.+'&quot;

#include &lt;include/h/foo&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.BEAM.+'&quot;

#include &lt;include/foo.h&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.BEAM.+'&quot;

#include &lt;foo.include.h&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.BEAM.+'&quot;

#include &lt;beam/include/h/foo&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.+'&quot;

#include &lt;beam/include/foo.h&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.+'&quot;

#include &lt;beam/foo.include.h&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.+'&quot;

#include &lt;foo.beam.include.h&gt;
cc -I&quot;//'SYNLIB.+'&quot;
</pre>
<p>

<h1>Names longer than 8 characters</h1>

</p>
<p>
When a path in an include directive gets translated to a PDS name, any
pieces (qualifiers or members names) which exceed 8 characters in length
get truncated. Long names on the command line do not get truncated (they
will just never match anything, since no such name could exist). 
</p>
<p>
To take a ludicrous example, if you have the following include directive
in a source file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#include &lt;longdirectory/longerdirectory/longfilename.longsuffixone.secondsuffix&gt;
</pre>
<p>

And you pass the following <span class="code">-I&quot;//'BEAM.INCLUDE.+'&quot;</span> on the 
command line, then the resulting dataset name would be 
<span class="code">//'BEAM.INCLUDE.LONGDIRE.LONGERDI.LONGSUFF.SECONDSU(LONGFILE)</span>.
