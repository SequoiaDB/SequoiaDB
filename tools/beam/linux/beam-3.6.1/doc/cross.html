<h1 class="title">Dealing with Foreign Compilers and Operating Systems</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
This document is required reading for everybody who wants to run
BEAM on source code that is being developed on operating systems other than
those that BEAM supports natively.
</p>
<p>
<font color=red><span class="strong">Warning:</span></font>
This task is not for the faint of heart and you cannot possibly accomplish
this in an hour or so. You should plan to spend at least a day depending on how
familiar you are with your compiler. An investigative mind and good engineering
skills help, too.
</p>
<p>
I will be using two terms in the rest of this document frequently. They are:
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Native Environment</span><br>
This is the environment in which your code is developed. It includes
the compiler, all header files, the operating system, and environment
variables. Sometimes I will use the phrase <span class="term">native compiler</span> which
denotes the compiler from the native environment.
</p>
<p>
Is your native environment UNIX-like?
In case of Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, and GNU/Linux the answer is "yes".
In case of Windows, OS/2, z/OS, AS/400 or any mainframe based OS the answer
is "no".
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">BEAM Environment</span><br>
This is the environment in which you will run BEAM.
</p>
<p>
To run BEAM on code that is being developed in a different environment
requires that we model that environment to some extent. 
The bad news is, that, in general, we won't be able to do that 
<span class="strong">exactly</span>. The good news is, that typically an approximate modeling 
of the native environment is good enough for BEAM purposes.
</p>
<p>
OK. Take a breath. Here it goes.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Part #1: Assembling the source code</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Step #1: Install BEAM</h2>

If you have not yet done so, go and install BEAM. You will find everything
you need on the <a href="index.html">BEAM home page</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #2: Copy source code to the BEAM environment</h2>

Note, that BEAM assumes the source code is written using the ASCII 
character set. If your native environment uses a different character
set, you will have to convert your source code to ASCII first.
Make sure, that (after conversion) the files do not contain any 
non printable characters. Non-printable characters will cause 
syntax errors later. Get rid of them. Now.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #3: Copy the system headers</h2>

<span class="term">System headers</span> includes three sets of header files
<ul>
<li>C library, e.g. <span class="file">stdio.h</span>, <span class="file">stddef.h</span>
<li>C++ library, e.g. <span class="file">iostream</span>
<li>OS headers, e.g. <span class="file">unistd.h</span>
</ul>
While, in general, it is best to copy the headers, it is also a bit of work
to assemble them all. If both the native system and the BEAM environment 
is UNIX-like you can
sometimes get away with using the header files in the BEAM environment.
Examine your code and find out which system headers are being #include'd.
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
 <th>Included files</th>
 <th>Need native system headers</th>
</tr>
<tr align=center>
<td>Only <a href="standard-headers.html">Standard C/C++</a></td>
<td>probably not</td>
</tr>
<tr align=center>
<td><a href="standard-headers.html">Standard C/C++ and POSIX</a></td>
<td>maybe</td>
</tr>
<tr align=center>
<td>Other</td>
<td>definitely</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
If you need to copy the system headers, make sure you don't miss any.
Convert to ASCII if necessary. Write down where you installed them.
You'll need that later on.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #4: Case sensitivity of file names</h2>

The BEAM environment is case sensitive. That means, that <span class="file">foo.h</span>
and <span class="file">FOO.H</span> are two different files. Therefore, if you
<span class="code">#include &quot;FOO.H&quot;</span> but the file is named <span class="file">foo.h</span>
it will not be found. That is something you need to fix. As an example
you could convert all file names to lower case and then in all include
directives change any uppercase letters to lower case. Of course, this only 
works if file names are still unique after converting to lower case.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Part #2: Emulating the native compiler</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Step #5: Create a configuration file</h2>

You might have to refer to the
<a href="compiler_configuration.html">compiler configuration</a>
documentation and <a href="beam_configure.html">beam_configure</a>
reference documentation.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Step #5.1: beam_configure runs in the native environment</h3>

Easy as pie. Just run it.
Even if the native compiler is a cross compiler
<span class="command">beam_configure</span> is typically able to figure out some
characteristics of the target machine. In case there are several
compilers available in your native environment, e.g. a native compiler
and one or more cross compilers, you need to make sure
that you specify the right compiler. You need to specify the compiler
that you normally use for compiling your code.
Then let <span class="command">beam_configure</span> do its work, watch for warnings,
proofread the result and amend it as required. Proceed to step #6.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Step #5.2: beam_configure does not run in the native
environment</h3>

Run <span class="command">beam_configure</span> in the BEAM environment and create a 
template. Like so:
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam_configure --template --c   -o foo_c_config.tcl   # for a C compiler
beam_configure --template --cpp -o foo_cpp_config.tcl # for a C++ compiler
</pre>
<p>

Here, <span class="var">foo</span> is the name of your compiler configuration.
Later, when you run BEAM, you will refer to the output file by specifying
<span class="option">--beam::compiler=foo_c_config</span> and
<span class="option">--beam::compiler=foo_cpp_config</span> on the command line.
</p>
<p>
The configuration file is divided into several sections all of which you
will have to fill in. There are plenty of suggestions in the generated
template.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Step #5.2.1: Setting the language dialect</h3>

Easy as pie. See <a href="compiler_configuration.html#section1">this page</a> 
for a list of possible values:
</p>
<p>
<h3>Step #5.2.2: Setting the include path</h3>

You do remember where you installed the compiler's headers, don't you?
The ones you copied in step #2. For every directory with system headers 
add one or both of the following lines, depending on which languages
you are creating configuration files for:
</p>
<pre class="example">
lappend beam::compiler::c::system_include_path <span class="val">{/some/dir}</span>
lappend beam::compiler::cpp::system_include_path <span class="val">{/some/dir}</span>
</pre>
<p>

The directories will be searched in the specified order. The topmost 
directory is first on the search path.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Step #5.2.3: Defining the target machine</h3>

This includes the sizes of the built-in data types, endianess etc.
You probably know most of them. Otherwise consult the documentation for
the native compiler. Or you may try to compile and run 
<a href="target.c">this program</a> in the native environment.
Stuff the output of the program into the configuration file.
The most important piece is to get the <span class="var">target_sizeof_<span class="val">type</span></span>
correct. If you don't know the alignment requirements for the various
data types, use the same values for <span class="var">target_alignof_<span class="val">name</span></span>
that you used for <span class="var">target_sizeof_<span class="val">name</span></span>.
You can fine-tune the other things later.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Step #5.4: Predefined macros of the native compiler</h3>

You need to find out what the predefined macros of the compiler in the
native environment are. It is not sufficient to find out <span class="strong">what</span> is
defined, it is equally important to know <span class="strong">how</span> those macros expand.
Some compilers have command line flags that make them spit out this
information. Otherwise, the compiler documentation should have this 
information. Also note, that the C and C++ compilers may have different
predefined macros. It is very important to get this as correct as possible, 
because most likely the header files from your native environment will depend
on these macros being defined in a certain way.
</p>
<p>
For every predefined macro, add one of the following to your configuration
file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
set beam::compiler::c::predefined_macro(<span class="val">name</span>)   {<span class="val">replacement text</span>}
set beam::compiler::c::predefined_macro(<span class="val">name</span>)   {}
</pre>
<p>

Use the latter form for macros that are defined but expand to nothing.
Change <span class="var">beam::compiler::c</span> to <span class="var">beam::compiler::cpp</span>
if you are writing a compiler configuration file for C++.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #6: Getting EDGs predefined macros</h2>

The EDG frontend only defines those macros that are required by the
corresponding language standard. No more and no less. You can find the
detailed list <a href="edg-predefined-macros.html">in this document</a>.
</p>
<p>
If your native compiler does not define (some of) these macros or defines
them differently, you need to first undefine them in the configuration file
and later add the correct definition, like so:
</p>
<pre class="example">
set beam::compiler::c::standard_predefined_macros &quot;* - __STDC__ __STDC_VERSION__&quot;

set beam::compiler::c::predefined_macro(__STDC__)            0
set beam::compiler::c::predefined_macro(__STDC_VERSION__)   42
</pre>
<p>

Again, change <span class="var">beam::compiler::c</span> to <span class="var">beam::compiler::cpp</span>
if you are writing a compiler configuration file for C++.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #7: Converting compiler flags</h2>

When you compile in the native environment there are probably command line
flags being passed to the compiler (possibly different from file to file).
These need to be translated into EDG command line flags. Note that some 
command line flags have the side effect of <span class="code">#define</span>-ing or
<span class="code">#undef</span>-ing macros. You need to find out. You can ignore flags
that control optimization levels unless they have side effects.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the file <span class="file">tcl/beam_map_vac_flags.tcl</span> from
the BEAM distro. It shows how we did this for the AIX compilers.
</p>
<p>
For the <span class="var">foo</span> compiler you can name the mapper file whatever
you want, but remember the name, because you will have to load it
into beam in the next step. For this example, let's call it
<span class="file">foo_map_flags.tcl</span>.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #8: Assembling the command line</h2>

You will invoke <span class="command">beam_compile</span> like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam_compile -c --beam::compiler=foo_cpp_config.tcl \
                --beam::compiler=foo_c_config.tcl   \
                --beam::compiler=foo_map_flags.tcl  <span class="val">filename</span>
</pre>
<p>

Basically, you source the configuration file for the compiler / target
(<span class="file">foo_cpp_config.tcl</span>) as well as the argument mapper
(<span class="file">foo_map_flags.tcl</span>). In order for those files to be found
they need to be on <a href="search_path.html">BEAMs search path</a> or
you need to specify an absolute pathname.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Step #10: Converting environment variables</h2>

Does the native compiler look for environment variables? If so, are any 
defined in the native environment?
If so, determine whether they have any side effects like
<span class="code">#define</span>-ing macro names and such.
</p>
<p>
<h2>What to expect</h2>

The amount of code that will parse successfully in the BEAM environment
depends significantly on how correct you could fake the native environment.
This in turn depends on available information which can be tough to
come by (e.g. the predefined macros of the native compiler). But even, if you
manage to do that perfectly, it does not guarantee 100% success. Here are
a few things to consider:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><span class="strong">C++programming language</span><br>
The language changed significantly over time in particular in the last few
years before it was standardized (1998). EDG attempts to implement the C++
standard but also supports several C++ anachronisms. Still, some code
might be rejected despite all your tweaking and
fiddling with the language configuration.
</p>
<p>
<li><span class="strong">Compiler extensions</span><br>
Your compiler may have extensions to the language standards,
e.g allow K&R style function declarations in C++ code, additional keywords
for specifying linkage etc. Sometimes you can work around these by defining
appropriate macros. 
</ul>
