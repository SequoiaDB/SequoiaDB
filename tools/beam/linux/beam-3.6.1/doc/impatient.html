<h1 class="title">BEAM for the Impatient</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
So, you want to get going in a hurry, eh? To illustrate BEAM
copy the following program into a file, say <span class="file">bug.c</span>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
int *p, b;

void
foo(int a)
{
  int c;

  b = 0;
  if(!p) 
    c = 1;

  if(c &gt; a)
    c += p[1];
}
</pre>
<p>
If you have access to AFS then issue this command:
</p>
<pre class="example">
/afs/eda.fishkill.ibm.com/ship/beam/2.0/demo/bin/beam_compile -c bug.c
</pre>
<p>
If you do not have AFS access you need to <a href="install.html">install BEAM</a> before trying it.
</p>
<p>
For the code above, BEAM will issue messages like these:
</p>
<pre class="example">
BEAM_VERSION=3.1.1
BEAM_ROOT=/tmp/flo
BEAM_BUILD_ROOT=/tmp/flo
BEAM_DIRECTORY_WRITE_INNOCENTS=
BEAM_DIRECTORY_WRITE_ERRORS=

-- ERROR1     /*uninitialized*/     &gt;&gt;&gt;ERROR1_foo_9269b7a63
&quot;bug.c&quot;, line 12: uninitialized `c'
ONE POSSIBLE PATH LEADING TO THE ERROR:
 &quot;bug.c&quot;, line 6: allocating `c'
 &quot;bug.c&quot;, line 9: the if-condition is false
 &quot;bug.c&quot;, line 12: getting the value of `c'

 VALUES AT THE END OF THE PATH:
  p != 0 



-- ERROR2     /*dereferencing NULL*/     &gt;&gt;&gt;ERROR2_foo_c8d0e0a70
&quot;bug.c&quot;, line 13: invalid operation involving NULL pointer
ONE POSSIBLE PATH LEADING TO THE ERROR:
 &quot;bug.c&quot;, line 9: the if-condition is true (used as evidence that error is possible)
 &quot;bug.c&quot;, line 12: the if-condition is true
 &quot;bug.c&quot;, line 13: using operation `[]' to dereference NULL pointer `p'

 VALUES AT THE END OF THE PATH:
  c = 1 
  p = 0 
  a &lt;= 0
</pre>
<p>
BEAM issued two complaints starting with <span class="code">--</span>.
The first five lines starting with <span class="code">BEAM_</span> are for integration with 
emacs, and you can ignore them for now. Each complaint has a <span class="term">name</span>, like ERROR1.
Detailed explanation about each complaint can be found 
<a href="builtin.html">in this document</a> under its name.
</p>
<p>
Following the complaint name is a C comment. Add that comment to the 
source file on the line of the complaint and BEAM will no longer issue 
that complaint. Go ahead and add <span class="code">/*uninitialized*/</span> on line 12 and
rerun BEAM. You'll see that ERROR1 is no longer reported.
</p>
<p>
But what if changing the source code (and adding that comment) is not an
option? You could still mark the complaint innocent, by adding that weird looking
character string (the one beginning with <span class="code">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>) to a so called 
<span class="term">innocent file</span> which is kept in some persistent location.
Next time you invoke BEAM you tell it about that location and it will no longer
issue the complaint. This method of declaring a complaint innocent is quite useful
but it requires maintaining persistent storage between BEAM runs. It is meant for
people who run BEAM regularly. The details of how to set up that persistent storage
area correctly are explained in the <a href="build.html">build integration guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
OK, now back to the messages. The meat of the complaint is the lines that look like 
<span class="code">&quot;bug.c&quot;, line 12: ....</span>. Some complaints  have just one line, while others
list a whole path. The symptom of the problem materializes on the last line of the path.
BEAM says that there is something wrong along that path. It certainly does not mean
to say that there is something wrong on every line listed. It is even possible that
every line along the path is correct, there is just something missing. It is up to you
to find the cause, but there is help. We highly recommend trying the emacs macro
package that comes with the BEAM distribution. It allows browsing the complaints,
while looking at the source code (possibly with a highlighted path). A complaint can
be marked innocent with just one keystroke. <a href="emacs.html">Sound interesting?</a>

BEAM, configure it for your compiler, and get it running on your project.
