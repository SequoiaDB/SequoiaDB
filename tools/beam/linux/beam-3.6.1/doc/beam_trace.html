<a name="intro"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>


</p>
<p>
      Projects that wish to use BEAM must integrate BEAM into
      their build environment. This usually requires a build
      expert to modify the build machinery so that BEAM can
      be invoked at the appropriate time and with the correct
      command-line arguments.
</p>
<p>
      BEAM has a solution to this problem. For
      <a href="#supported">supported platforms</a>, BEAM can
      automatically trace your build for you. This means that
      BEAM will analyze all of the source code that you are
      compiling, with <span class="strong">no changes to your build system</span>.
</p>
<p>
      If your build is smart enough to only recompile those
      source files that have changed since the previous build,
      then <span class="command">beam_trace</span> will only analyze those
      same modified files. Using <span class="command">beam_trace</span>
      with incremental builds is very beneficial.
</p>
<p>
      This magic is possible due to the <span class="command">beam_trace</span>
      command. This command can watch almost any build and
      will invoke a script whenever programs are spawned off.
      If a script is used that invokes <span class="command">beam_compile</span>
      at the appropriate time, then BEAM can automatically
      analyze a project simply by tracing the build.
</p>
<p>
<a name="running"></a><h1>Running beam_trace</h1>


</p>
<p>
      The <span class="command">beam_trace</span> program takes in a set of BEAM
      options followed by a double-hyphen (<span class="val">--</span>) and the
      command you want to invoke.
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam_trace --beam::complaint_file=/tmp/beam.out -- make all
</pre>
<p>

      All of the BEAM-specific options need to go before the <span class="val">--</span>,
      and your normal build command and build options go after the
      <span class="val">--</span>.
</p>
<p>
      Whenever your build invokes a <a href="#supported_compilers">supported compiler</a>, <span class="command">beam_trace</span> will run BEAM
      for you automatically.
</p>
<p>
      Be sure to give at least a complaint file for BEAM to write to.
      Due to the nature of <span class="command">beam_trace</span>, BEAM itself will
      not be able to write to STDOUT.
</p>
<p>
      You can pass any other BEAM options you would like. If you
      are tracing Java builds, we recommend you include the
      <span class="option">--beam::skip_cmdline_files_if_analyzed</span> option,
      since Java compilers we've tested with invoke themselves
      twice on the source file; without this option, BEAM would
      analyze the file twice as well, leading to slower builds.
</p>
<p>
<a name="custom"></a><h1>Custom trace scripts</h1>


</p>
<p>
      The default action of <span class="command">beam_trace</span> is to run BEAM
      whenever a supported compiler is seen.
</p>
<p>
      You can override this behavior by providing your own script
      that <span class="command">beam_trace</span> will run whenever a process is
      executed during your build. This script can do whatever you
      would like it to.
</p>
<p>
      We have an example script which also looks for compiler
      invocations and runs BEAM so you have a starting point to
      work from.
</p>
<p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copy <a href="beam_trace_example.pl">doc/beam_trace_example.pl</a>
          from your BEAM install directory to some permanent location. It 
          will need to be accessible from your build.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit the top of your copy of the trace script.
          It is well-commented, and should provide direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <span class="command">beam_trace</span> with your trace script:
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam_trace --beam::complaint_file=/tmp/beam.out beam_trace_example.pl -- make all
</pre>
<p>

          In real life, you want to replace <span class="command">make all</span> with whatever
          your build command is.
        </li>
      </ol>
</p>
<p>
<a name="howitworks"></a><h1>How beam_trace works</h1>


</p>
<p>
      The <span class="command">beam_trace</span> command watches any process
      you run (the <span class="term">target process</span>). Any time the target process
      runs a sub-command (a <span class="term">target sub-process</span>), the 
      <span class="command">beam_trace</span> command will invoke the specified
      trace script. If a trace script isn't given, <span class="command">beam_trace</span>
      uses BEAM's built-in <span class="command">beam_trace_dispatch</span> program,
      which runs BEAM for you automatically.
</p>
<p>
      The trace script is invoked with the target sub-process's
      command line as arguments.
      The environment is the same as the environment in which
      the target process will execute, with the following exceptions:
</p>
<p>
      <ul>
        <li>STDIN is redirected from /dev/null</li>
        <li>STDOUT is redirected to /dev/null</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>
      That means that the trace script cannot read from STDIN and it
      cannot write to STDOUT.
      This is so that the trace script doesn't interfere with the
      normal execution of the target sub-process. Any messages
      should be written to STDERR or /dev/tty, depending on what
      you are doing.
</p>
<p>
      The script itself is not traced by <span class="command">beam_trace</span>,
      but the target sub-process will be, so that recursive command
      invocations are all traced by the trace script.
</p>
<p>
      Any BEAM options that were given to the <span class="command">beam_trace</span>
      command will end up in the <span class="env">BEAM_TRACE_OPTS</span> environment
      variable, encoded as a <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>
      list.
</p>
<p>
      Different trace scripts can do different things. We provide
      an <a href="beam_trace_example.pl">example trace script</a>
      that will invoke BEAM, but the possibilities are limitless.
</p>
<p>
<a name="supported"></a><h1>Supported Platforms</h1>


</p>
<p>
      Currently, the <span class="command">beam_trace</span> program is supported
      on the following systems and executables:
</p>
<p>
      <ul>
        <li>32-bit and 64-bit Linux-x86</li>
        <li>32-bit and 64-bit Linux-s390</li>
        <li>32-bit and 64-bit Linux-ppc</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>
<a name="supported_compilers"></a><h1>Supported Compilers</h1>


</p>
<p>
      If you are using our default tracing, we support the
      following compilers:
</p>
<p>
      <ul>
       <li>GCC</li>
       <li>IBM or Sun Java SDK</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>
      If you write your own <a href="#custom">custom trace script</a>,
      then you can use any compiler you would like.
</p>
<p>
<a name="limitations"></a><h1>Limitations</h1>


</p>
<p>
      The <span class="command">beam_trace</span> program uses <span class="var">LD_PRELOAD</span>
      to trace target processes and target sub-processes. This means
      that the following processes cannot be traced:
</p>
<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programs statically linked against libc</li>
        <li>Programs that don't have ELF headers</li>
        <li>Programs that don't invoke other programs as separate
            processes (like <a href="#ant">ant</a>)</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>
      These limitations exist because <span class="command">beam_trace</span> uses the
      ELF header to decide whether or not the child program can be
      traced. If the program has no ELF header, the <span class="command">beam_trace</span>
      program doesn't know how to trace it, and will fail to do so.
</p>
<p>
<a name="ant"></a><h1>How to trace ant</h1>


</p>
<p>
      The <span class="command">beam_trace</span> program won't work on <span class="command">ant</span>
      by default because <span class="command">ant</span> doesn't execute the Java
      compiler as a separate process. Instead, <span class="command">ant</span> loads the
      Java compiler in-core and processes the source files directly.
</p>
<p>
      If you modify <span class="command">ant</span> so that it executes the Java compiler
      as a separate process, <span class="command">beam_trace</span> can trace <span class="command">ant</span>
      builds directly. Directions on how to do this are in the
      <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/javac.html">ant documentation</a>.
      See the <span class="code">fork</span> attribute.
</p>
<p>
      As an alternative, you can use <a href="ant_ref.html">BEAM's ant plugin</a>
      to integrate BEAM into <span class="command">ant</span> builds directly.
