<h1 class="title">Interprocedural Analysis (IPA)</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

Interprocedural analysis (IPA) allows BEAM to extend its
analysis "across functions". It contains two major ingredients:
a suite of algorithms to determine properties of functions
and an infrastructure (repository) to store them.
Examples of those properties include restrictions on parameter
values, whether a function may return to its caller, what
variables a function modifies etc.
Keep in mind that IPA is both a bottomless pit and an active
research area. In other words, you're never done with it.
We will be adding more analyses as time progresses,
focusing on those that bring the most bang for the buck.
</p>
<p>
Adding IPA has two advantages:
<ol>
<li>Possibly find more code problems
<li>Better suppression of invalid complaints
</ol>
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate these advantages consider the following example:
</p>
<pre class="example">
void foo(int *p)
{
  if (p == NULL) {
    bar(p);
    die();
  }

  *p = 10;
}
</pre>
<p>

Without IPA, BEAM would issue a complaint
about a possible NULL-pointer dereference at <span class="code">*p = 10;</span>.
But that complaint is invalid because, as its name suggests,
the function <span class="function">die</span> does not return.
In addition, BEAM fails to complain about passing 
<span class="code">NULL</span> to <span class="function">bar</span>
because it does not know that <span class="function">bar</span> cannot handle a
<span class="code">NULL</span> argument. 
</p>
<p>
<h1>How IPA works</h1>

From a user's perspective IPA can be viewed as a two-step process.
In the first step function properties are determined and stored
in a repository which is located somewhere underneath the directory
that you specify with <a href="parms.html#beam::data">beam::data</a>.
In the second step those properties will be used when analyzing
the functions.
So, ideally you would run BEAM twice on your code. Once to
determine the properties and once to do the analysis. 
This would roughly double the runtime which 
might not be acceptable. And most likely it would mean that you
would have to modify your build process.
Therefore, BEAM does both property computation and analysis at the
same time. The cost of doing so is some loss of precision. 
For the example above, when analyzing <span class="function">foo</span> the properties
for <span class="function">bar</span> and <span class="function">die</span> may or may not be available
depending on whether the files containing those functions have already
been analyzed.
But this imprecision only exists for the very first IPA run.
For all following runs function properties are readily available.

<a name="enable"></a><h1>Enabling IPA</h1>


Did you read the previous chapters?
Ok then.
There are 4 variables that are relevant to IPA:
<dl>
<dt><span class="var">beam::ipa</span>
<dd>This variable specifies the IPA mode. Currently, only one value is
supported: <span class="val">all</span>. This mode means: interleave property computation
and analysis. As a side effect setting this variable enables IPA.
</p>
<p>
<dt><span class="var">beam::data</span>
<dd>The value of <a href="parms.html#beam::data">beam::data</a> is a
directory. BEAM will use a subdirectory underneath <span class="var">beam::data</span>
as the IPA repository. Function properties will be stored there.
That way they do not interfere with 
<a href="innocent.html">innocent files</a> in case you're using those.
The BEAM process must have "write privileges" in this directory.
This variable is mandatory for IPA.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Important:</span> Do not use one <span class="var">beam::data</span> for several,
independent software components. The reason is that a function with a 
specific name might be defined more than once and that would completely
confuse BEAM when it searches for function properties.
</p>
<p>
<dt><span class="var">beam::base_data</span>
<dd>The value of <a href="parms.html#beam::data">beam::base_data</a>
is a list of directories that BEAM should search for function
properties. Those directories will only be read, not written to. 
Note, that it is not necessary to add the <span class="var">beam::data</span> directory
to <span class="var">beam::base_data</span> as <span class="var">beam::data</span> will always be
searched.
The BEAM process must have "read privileges" in this directory.
This variable is optional for IPA.
</p>
<p>
<dt><span class="var">beam::build_root</span>
<dd>The value of <span class="var">beam::build_root</span> is a directory that identifies
the root of a build tree. A source file that is analyzed must be
located in the directory tree rooted in <span class="var">beam::build_root</span>.
This variable is mandatory for IPA.
</dl>
</p>
<p>
As usual those variables can be either defined in a parameter
file or specified on the command line.
