    <a name="overview"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>


</p>
<p>
      An <span class="term">argument mapper file</span> describes 
      the format of the command-line so that BEAM can
      process the options and analyze the source files
      successfully. This file contains Tcl procedures
      that BEAM will call during execution when it
      needs to understand what options and source files
      exist on the command-line for the emulated compiler.
</p>
<p>
      BEAM provides argument mappers for several
      <a href="#supported">supported compilers</a>. If your
      compiler isn't listed, you will need to write an argument
      mapper of your own. The details of this are described
      <a href="#custom">below</a>.
</p>
<p>
<hr />

</p>
<p>
    <a name="loading"></a><h1>Loading an Argument Mapper</h1>


</p>
<p>
      BEAM needs the argument mapper description file at two
      different points during its <a href="execution.html">execution</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <span class="command">beam_compile</span> driver will use
        the argument description procedure (set with
        <span class="function">beam::set_describer</span>) to find the
        source files in the command-line so it knows
        how many times to run the <span class="var">beam_<span class="val">lang</span></span>
        executable.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span class="command">beam_compile</span> driver will use
        the argument expanding procedure (set with
        <span class="function">beam::set_expander</span>) to expand
        <a href="atfile.html">@file</a> arguments and
        other things (some compilers add arguments from
        environment variables at this point).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span class="command">beam_compile</span> driver will use
        the argument configuring procedure (set with
        <span class="function">beam::set_configurer</span>) to expand
        those arguments that would affect the outcome
        of <span class="command">beam_configure</span>. This is only
        needed when the <span class="option">--beam::prefixcc</span>
        option is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span class="var">beam_<span class="val">lang</span></span> executable
        will use the mapping procedure (set with
        <span class="function">beam::set_mapper</span>) to translate
        the command-line flags into BEAM settings
        for the <a href="compiler_configuration.html">compiler configuration file</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      In both places, an argument mapper needs to be located
      and loaded. The following search rules are used:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If an argument mapper has been loaded with
        <span class="option">--beam::compiler=<span class="val">file</span></span>,
        then the loaded file is used. Using
        <span class="option">--beam::source=</span> for argument
        mappers is deprecated, and should <span class="strong">not be used
        any longer</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, BEAM determines the name of the file containing
        the argument mapper from the <span class="var">&quot;cc&quot;</span> variable
        which was set in the
        <a href="compiler_configuration.html">compiler configuration
        file</a> that has been loaded. The mapper file will be named
        <span class="file">beam_map_<span class="val">name</span>_flags.tcl</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <span class="var">name</span> is set to <span class="val">&quot;none&quot;</span>, a special
        argument mapper will be used (in <span class="file">beam_map_none_flags.tcl</span>)
        that doesn't do anything to the command line. This is only useful
        for debugging, and <span class="strong">not recommended</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, the file name is searched for and loaded from
        the <a href="search_path.html">search path</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
      Examples:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# This will use the default argument mapper from BEAM,
# defined in 'tcl/beam_map_default_flags.tcl'.

beam_compile test.c

# This will use the GCC argument mapper, defined
# in 'tcl/beam_map_gcc_flags.tcl', because the given
# gcc.tcl compiler configuration file was generated
# from the GCC compiler

beam_compile --beam::compiler=gcc.tcl test.c

# This will use the argument mapper defined in
# 'map_flags.tcl'

beam_compile --beam::compiler=map_flags.tcl test.c
</pre>
<p>

      In most cases, your compiler configuration file will be
      for one of the <a href="#supported">supported compilers
      below</a>, meaning that BEAM will automatically load a
      built-in argument mapper and everything will work automatically.
</p>
<p>
      If you are using a compiler configuration file for
      a compiler that we don't support, you will have to
      <a href="#custom">write your own mapper</a>.

    <h2>Passing options to EDG directly</h2>

</p>
<p>
      These argument mappers usually don't allow any flags
      through that they don't recognize as flags to their own
      compilers. This means that if you wish to pass an argument
      to the EDG parser directly, it will be filtered out as an
      unrecognized option. The correct way to specify EDG arguments
      directly is with the flag <span class="option">--edg=<span class="val">option</span></span>.
      See the <a href="quoting-hell.html">quoting hell</a> document for
      details.

    <a name="custom"></a><h1>Writing your own argument mapper</h1>


</p>
<p>
      <span class="strong">WARNING</span>: Emulating compilers is difficult.
      Mixing compiler feature with BEAM language parsers is
      black magic and because of all the platforms and
      compilers we need to support. Because of this, the
      format of procedures, arguments, and return values 
      specified here <span class="strong">may change with new BEAM releases</span>.
      We will try to minimize these changes, and we will document
      them all. We don't expect many people to have to write
      their own mappers, and if they write any for popular
      compilers, we will consider including them in BEAM proper,
      so this restriction shouldn't affect many people at all.
      That being said, pay attention to BEAM's release notes
      to keep up-to-date with mapper changes if you write you
      own mapper.
</p>
<p>
      If BEAM does not contain an argument mapper for your
      compiler, you can write your own. BEAM ships with
      an example file that you can copy and customize
      if you would like. The file is in the BEAM installation,
      and it is named <span class="file">tcl/beam_map_example_flags.tcl</span>.
</p>
<p>
      The argument mapper file is a Tcl file that contains
      some important Tcl procedures: the <span class="term">argument describer</span>,
      the <span class="term">argument mapper</span>, the <span class="term">argument expander</span>,
      and the <span class="term">argument configurer</span>. These procedures take
      in the command-line at different points in the BEAM run
      and they return important information to BEAM.
</p>
<p>
      To load a custom argument mapper, either specify
      <span class="option">--beam::compiler=<span class="val">tcl_file</span></span> on
      the command-line, or source it from your
      <a href="compiler_configuration.html">compiler configuration file</a>,
      which you should already be passing to <span class="option">--beam::compiler=</span>.
</p>
<p>
      The argument mapper Tcl file may be loaded before
      <span class="var">::beam::lang</span> is set in Tcl, so it
      should not be used. However, while inside the
      argument mapper proc (described below), the
      language is known and <span class="var">::beam::lang</span>
      can be used.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>The argument describer</h2>

</p>
<p>
      This Tcl procedure is used by <span class="command">beam_compile</span>
      to describe the command-line so that
      <span class="command">beam_compile</span> can find the source files and
      languages to analyze.
</p>
<p>
      This procedure can have any name, and it must be
      registered with BEAM by calling
      <span class="code">beam::set_describer <span class="val">proc_name</span></span>
      from within the argument mapper file. The <span class="val">proc_name</span>
      argument should be the fully-qualified name of the Tcl
      procedure to use.
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam::set_describer ::my_namespace::my_describe_flags

namespace eval ::my_namespace {

  proc my_describe_flags { flags } {
    ...
  }

}
</pre>
<p>

      The procedure takes in one argument, which is the
      a list of command-line flags. The binary name that
      would appear in <span class="code">argv[0]</span> of a C program
      will <span class="strong">not</span> appear in this list, so there
      is no need to skip the first argument.
</p>
<p>
      The procedure should return a list of the same length
      as the argument list passed in to the parameter. This
      returned list is called an <span class="term">argument description list</span>,
      and it contains a description for each item in the
      incoming argument list, in the same order.
</p>
<p>
      The returned description list must have the same length
      as the argument list that was passed in. Each item
      of the argument description list is called an
      <span class="term">argument description</span>. Each argument description
      is also a list, and must contain at least one item.
</p>
<p>
      The <span class="command">beam_compile</span> binary looks for two
      specific things in the description list. These are
      in Tcl list notation:
</p>
<pre class="example">
{ source <span class="val">language</span> <span class="val">filename</span> }
{ delete }
</pre>
<p>

      The first is an argument description which contains three elements:
      the keyword <span class="code">source</span>, a language that BEAM understands
      (c, cpp, java, pl8, etc), and the name of the file to analyze in
      that language.
</p>
<p>
      The second contains simply the keyword <span class="code">delete</span>. Any
      flag that is described with this keyword will be removed in
      the frontend before the language binary is invoked. This can
      be used to remove flags that would otherwise cause problems
      in the language binary.
</p>
<p>
      All other items of the description list will be ignored.
      This is useful because the description proc can now be
      used to handle all of the command-line logic, and if
      the argument mapper calls the argument describer, then
      the logic need not be duplicated. See
      <span class="file">tcl/beam_map_example_flags.tcl</span> for an
      example of this in action. More advanced examples
      can be seen in some of the other BEAM argument mappers
      that ship with BEAM.
</p>
<p>
      Here is an example. Given this command-line (in Tcl list notation):
</p>
<pre class="example">
{  -c  -g  file.c  -o  file.o  }
</pre>
<p>

      The argument describer proc might return a list like so:
</p>
<pre class="example">
{  {ignore}  {delete}  {source c file.c}  {pass}  {pass}  }
</pre>
<p>

      This tells <span class="command">beam_compile</span> to analyze the single
      source file "file.c" (since it is the only argument description
      that has the <span class="code">source</span> keyword as the first element).
      The second flag, <span class="option">-g</span>, will be removed from the
      command-line before the language binary is invoked.
      The rest of the descriptions are ignored.
</p>
<p>
      Since the argument mapper lives in the same Tcl file and is
      written by the same author, it can call the argument describer
      and use other keywords in that list to do its job. Our example
      argument describer returned <span class="code">pass</span> keywords and 
      <span class="code">ignore</span> keywords, and our example argument mapper
      below will use them to decide which flags to keep and which
      to toss away.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>The argument mapper</h2>

</p>
<p>
      This Tcl procedure is used by <span class="code">beam_<span class="val">lang</span></span>
      to map compiler-specific flags to flags that the BEAM
      language-specific parser will understand. It also sets up
      the variables in the 
      <a href="compiler_configuration.html">compiler configuration</a>
      namespace.
</p>
<p>
      This procedure can have any name, and it must be
      registered with BEAM by calling
      <span class="code">beam::set_mapper <span class="val">proc_name</span></span> from within
      the argument mapper file. The <span class="val">proc_name</span>
      argument should be the fully-qualified name of the Tcl
      procedure to use.
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam::set_mapper ::my_namespace::my_map_flags

namespace eval ::my_namespace {

  proc my_map_flags { flags } {
    ...
  }

}
</pre>
<p>

      The procedure takes in one argument, which is the
      a list of command-line flags. The binary name that
      would appear in <span class="code">argv[0]</span> of a C program
      will <span class="strong">not</span> appear in this list, so there
      is no need to skip the first argument.
</p>
<p>
      Since the <span class="code">beam_<span class="val">lang</span></span> executable
      is only called once for each source file, there
      will only be one source file in the command-line
      passed to the argument mapper. The language will
      also be known (it is set in the <span class="var">::beam::lang</span>
      variable).
</p>
<p>
      The procedure should return a list of the command-line
      flags to pass to the BEAM parser that will be used
      for the current language (EDG is used for C and C++,
      for example). The source file should probably appear
      somewhere on this command-line, as well as parser-specific
      versions of the important native compiler flags that
      have been translated.
</p>
<p>
      This procedure should also make any needed modifications
      to the BEAM <a href="compiler_configuration.html">
      compiler configuration</a> namespace.
</p>
<p>
      To keep the command-line logic in one place, the mapper
      can simply call the argument describer proc to decide
      what each command-line argument does, and then modifiy
      the output list depending on what is seen.
</p>
<p>
      This example assumes that <span class="function">my_describe_flags</span>
      returns the list shown in the example above, with
      <span class="code">ignore</span> and <span class="code">pass</span> keywords.
      Given that, the map_flags proc could be written to
      include the sources and <span class="code">pass</span> arguments
      in the returned command-line.
</p>
<p>
      With this argument list (in Tcl notation):
</p>
<pre class="example">
{  -c  -g  file.c  -o  file.o  }
</pre>
<p>

      and this argument description list from 
      your custom <span class="function">my_describe_flags</span>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
{  {ignore}  {ignore}  {source c file.c}  {pass}  {pass}  }
</pre>
<p>

      then the argument mapper may decide to return this command-line
      based on those keywords:
</p>
<pre class="example">
{  file.c  -o  file.o  }
</pre>
<p>

    <h2>The argument expander</h2>

</p>
<p>
      This Tcl procedure is used by <span class="code">beam_compile</span>
      to expand and add to the command-line early in the option
      parsing process of BEAM. This routine is responsible for
      expanding <a href="atfile.html">@file</a> arguments, adding in
      arguments based on environment variables, etc. It should
      return a new command-line that BEAM will continue to parse.

<p>
      This procedure can have any name, and it must be
      registered with BEAM by calling
      <span class="code">beam::set_expander <span class="val">proc_name</span></span> from within
      the argument mapper file. The <span class="val">proc_name</span>
      argument should be the fully-qualified name of the Tcl
      procedure to use.
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam::set_expander ::my_namespace::my_expand_flags

namespace eval ::my_namespace {

  proc my_expand_flags { flags } {
    ...
  }

}
</pre>
<p>

      The procedure takes in one argument, which is the
      a list of command-line flags. The binary name that
      would appear in <span class="code">argv[0]</span> of a C program
      will <span class="strong">not</span> appear in this list, so there
      is no need to skip the first argument.
</p>
<p>
      The procedure should return a new command-line with
      any additional options added in.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>The argument configurer</h2>

</p>
<p>
      This Tcl procedure is used by <span class="code">beam_compile</span>
      to decide which options of those given need to be passed
      to <span class="command">beam_configure</span>. This only happens when
      <span class="option">--beam::prefixcc</span> is given on the command-line,
      which tells BEAM to automatically configure the compiler if
      it hasn't been run before in this mode. The routine must
      return a list of those options that will be passed
      on the end of the <span class="command">beam_configure</span> command-line.
</p>
<p>
      This procedure can have any name, and it must be
      registered with BEAM by calling
      <span class="code">beam::set_configurer <span class="val">proc_name</span></span> from within
      the argument mapper file. The <span class="val">proc_name</span>
      argument should be the fully-qualified name of the Tcl
      procedure to use.
</p>
<pre class="example">
beam::set_configurer ::my_namespace::my_config_flags

namespace eval ::my_namespace {

  proc my_config_flags { flags } {
    ...
  }

}
</pre>
<p>

      The procedure takes in one argument, which is the
      a list of command-line flags. The binary name that
      would appear in <span class="code">argv[0]</span> of a C program
      will <span class="strong">not</span> appear in this list, so there
      is no need to skip the first argument.
</p>
<p>
      The procedure should return a new command-line with
      only those options (it may be an empty list) that
      would affect the outcome of <span class="command">beam_configure</span>.
      For example, GCC's <span class="option">-m32</span> and <span class="option">-m64</span>
      options would affect the configuration by changing the
      size of <span class="code">long</span>, pointers, etc. Those options
      would be returned if they existed in <span class="code">$argv</span>.

<p>
    <h2>Setting compiler configuration namespace variables</h2>

</p>
<p>
      If you call <span class="function">::beam::compiler::import</span> at the top
      of your argument mapping proc, you can read and write all
      of the <a href="compiler_configuration.html#configuration">compiler configuration variables</a> as simple Tcl variables:
</p>
<pre class="example">
::beam::compiler::import
set language_dialect &quot;c&quot;
</pre>
<p>

    <h2>Updating old custom mappers</h2>

</p>
<p>
      If you were one of the few brave men who needed to write
      your own compiler argument mapper, here are some of the
      changes you can make to "update" it to work with this
      new framework.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add an argument describer and use it</li>
      <li>Don't call <span class="function">switch_language</span> any more
          because it is obsoleted by language descriptions
          and having the correct language from the start</li>
      <li>Use a custom namespace and import utilities instead
          of relying on the implicit ones (list_add, unescape_arg)</li>
      <li>Load it using <span class="option">--beam::compiler=</span> or source
          it from within your custom compiler configuration file</li>
      <li>Don't skip the first argument of the args passed in
          to the mapper any more. The binary name is no longer
          the first item in the list, so the first element should
          no longer be blindly copied to the new argv.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
