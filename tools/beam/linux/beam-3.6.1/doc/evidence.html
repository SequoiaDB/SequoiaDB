<h1 class="title">Rules of Evidence</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
Consider the following
</p>
<p>
Example 1:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, int N)
{
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

Is the function wrong in that it may divide by zero?
</p>
<p>
The answer to this question illustrates the difference between 
BEAM and formal verifiers.
Most formal verifiers would issue a complaint because they want to 
guarantee absence of all errors.
Therefore they place the burden of proof on the user, and
require that there be a precondition associated with the function
stating that it may not be called with <span class="code">N == 0</span>.
Such a precondition then allows all callers of <span class="function">Average</span> to be checked
for the possibility of passing zero to <span class="var">N</span>.
</p>
<p>
There is a general agreement that such a programming discipline
would lead to much more robust software,
and there is also a general agreement that programmers are not willing
to write formal specifications today.
We all write code assuming that our data structures are consistent,
that numbers are not large enough to cause overflows, etc;
it is not feasible to keep checking these properties.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, many programmers are willing to write informal specifications;
those may be helpful to other programmers, but not to automatic tools.
But even other programmers may not have complete trust in specifications, because they are 
not always updated as code changes.
As a result, somebody considering calling our function <span class="function">Average</span>
would likely just look at the source code to determine whether 
it can handle <span class="code">N == 0</span>.
</p>
<p>
Therefore BEAM does not require any specifications;
instead it tries to guess what a human would conclude by looking at a piece of code.
Thus BEAM places the burden of proof on itself rather than the programmer,
and issues a complaint only if it can find evidence that the error can actually 
occur.
Since no such evidence exists in the example as written,
BEAM would not issue a complaint about the function <span class="function">Average</span>.
Instead, guessing that a specification would require <span class="code">N != 0</span>,
any caller violating this requirement would be considered in error.
</p>
<p>
Example 2:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (N == 0)
    X = 1;
    
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

Example 2 is a typical form of evidence that BEAM would accept as
indicating that a division by 0 can occur. In this case BEAM would
complain about division by 0. The same would happen in the
following example.
</p>
<p>
Example 3:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (N != 0)
    X = 1;
    
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

Anybody looking at example 2 or example 3 would see a test for <span class="code">N == 0</span> or
<span class="code">N != 0</span>, and conclude
that the author of the function must have considered the possibility of 
being called with  <span class="code">N == 0</span>.
</p>
<p>
The next example might not be so obvious.
</p>
<p>
Example 4:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (N &gt;= 3) X = 3; else
  if (N == 2) X = 2; else
  if (N == 1) X = 1;
    
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

The author of examples 2 and 3 could not have expected 
any guarantee that  <span class="var">N</span> will never be zero.
But the author of example 4 could have expected such a guarantee
and still tested <span class="code">if (N == 1)</span> although that test would be 
unnecessary.
He might do that for aesthetics and clarity.
Actually, it would have been even clearer if he had written  
</p>
<p>
Example 5:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (N &gt;= 3) X = 3; else
  if (N == 2) X = 2; else
  if (N == 1) X = 1; else abort();
    
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

The default behavior of BEAM in example 4 is to issue the complaint about 
division by 0.
An analogous situation exists with switch statements
and omitted default labels.
</p>
<p>
Now suppose that example 2 was written in this form:
</p>
<p>
Example 6:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#define UPDATE_X    if (N == 0) X = 1;

int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  UPDATE_X;
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

After the macro expansion example 6 looks just like example 2.
However, there is an important difference --
the test of  <span class="var">N</span> is not explicitly written in the function <span class="function">Average</span>.
It is possible that <span class="function">Average</span> is not meant to handle  <span class="code">N == 0</span>
and the macro UPDATE_X is just a general purpose macro,
where the test of  <span class="var">N</span> is for somebody else's purposes.
Also a person examining the code of <span class="function">Average</span> is not likely
to conclude that it is meant to handle  <span class="code">N == 0</span>.
Therefore BEAM does not consider the test <span class="code">if (N == 0)</span> admissible evidence
if it is the result of macro expansion.
</p>
<p>
Now consider a slight twist.
</p>
<p>
Example 7:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#define UPDATE_X(A)    if (A == 0) X = 1;

int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  UPDATE_X(N);
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

In Example 7 the macro UPDATE_X tests a parameter A, and the implementation
of <span class="function">Average</span> passes  <span class="var">N</span> explicitly to the macro.
Will a person examining the code conclude that  <span class="var">N</span> is being tested explicitly?
For some macros, such as <span class="code">assert(N)</span>, the answer is "yes"
for others it may be "no".
BEAM tries to heuristically guess what a person would conclude;
in example 7 it would not issue the division by 0 complaint.
</p>
<p>
Loops introduce another interesting twist.
</p>
<p>
Example 8:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Foo(int *A, unsigned N)
{
  int Pivot;
  int I;
  
  for (I = 0; I &lt; N; I++) {
    if (A[I] != 0)
      Pivot = I;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>

Following the loop, <span class="var">Pivot</span> will be uninitialized if all the 
elements of the array A are zero.
Should that be reported?
BEAM will issue that complaint, and actually will provide the 
shortest path to the error, which is the case of  <span class="code">N == 0</span>.
This is in spite of no evidence that  <span class="var">N</span> could be zero.
</p>
<p>
(Please note that on the very first iteration of the loop
the test is <span class="code">0 &lt; N</span>.
If there were an explicit test <span class="code">if(0 &lt; N)</span>
anywhere, that would be strong evidence that  <span class="var">N</span> could be 0.
But the loop test cannot be considered to provide such strong evidence
because the programmer would write the loop the same way
even if he were sure that  <span class="var">N</span> cannot be zero.)
</p>
<p>
We could take the very conservative attitude that we cannot issue the complaint
unless we have evidence that  <span class="var">N</span> could be 0.
What if an error can occur only if a loop is executed once?
Should we need evidence that  <span class="var">N</span> can be 1?
What if an error can occur only if a loop is executed 100 times ...?
</p>
<p>
It is possible to take such a conservative attitude,
but it would prevent us from reporting many errors involving loops.
Instead we assume that it is possible for a loop to be executed
any number of times (including 0), without any evidence.
That is what most people expect of a loop.
</p>
<p>
Now reconsider example 1 modified as follows:
</p>
<p>
Example 9:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, int N)
{
  int I;
  for (I = 0; I &lt; N; I++)
    ;
  return Sum / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

We agreed that no division by 0 complaint should be issued for example 1.
Surely inserting a loop should not cause anybody to assume that the 
function <span class="function">Average</span> is prepared to handle <span class="code">N == 0</span>.
Therefore no complaint is issued for example 9.
</p>
<p>
This leads us to the following paradox.
</p>
<p>
Example 10:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Foo(int *A, unsigned N)
{
  int Pivot;
  int I;
  
  for (I = 0; I &lt; N; I++) {
    if (A[I] != 0)
      Pivot = I;
  }
  
  return Pivot / N;
}
</pre>
<p>

BEAM will complain about <span class="var">Pivot</span> being uninitialized in
case  <span class="code">N == 0</span>,
but will not issue the division by 0 complaint that can happen under
identical conditions.
The reason is that the rules of evidence are different in the two cases.
(Think of O.J. being convicted of murder in a civil case,
but not in a criminal case.)
This example is discussed below under "General statement of rules of evidence".
</p>
<p>
Example 11:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int A[10];

int Foo(int I)
{
  if (I &lt;= 10)
    return A[I];
}
</pre>
<p>

Should we issue a complaint that the subscript <span class="var">I</span>
may exceed the bounds of the array <span class="var">A</span>?
Most people would answer "yes" because the test 
probably should have been <span class="code">I &lt; 10</span>.
</p>
<p>
Should we issue a complaint that the subscript <span class="var">I</span>
might be negative?
Most people would answer "no" because 
it looks like the programmer is relying on <span class="var">I</span>
not being negative.
In other words, looking at the code and guessing what specification
the programmer would have written, most people would guess
that he would require <span class="code">I &gt;= 0</span>, but would not require 
<span class="code">I &lt; 10</span>.
</p>
<p>
In general a test contains a border value (10 in our example),
and the test is needed because values on both sides of the border are possible.
Therefore we assume that the test <span class="code">if(I &lt;= 10)</span>
implies that both <span class="code">I == 10</span> and <span class="code">I == 11</span>
are possible.
</p>
<p>
Example 12:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (N == 0)
    X = 1;
    
  if (Q) return Sum / N;
  else   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>

This is a modification of Example 2, where now the division by 0
happens if two conditions are satisfied -- 
<span class="code">N == 0</span> and <span class="var">Q</span> is true.
As discussed above, most programmers agree that testing 
<span class="code">N == 0</span> gives them an obligation to make <span class="function">Average()</span>
work if <span class="code">N == 0</span>; and similarly for <span class="var">Q</span>.
However, many would argue that it is OK to assume that at most one of the 
two conditions can happen, and therefore they have no obligation to make
their code work if both are true.
On the other hand, many would agree that they should document 
their assumption that one of <span class="code">N == 0</span>, <span class="var">Q</span>
must be false.
And once they agree to that kind of responsibility they accept BEAM
issuing a division by 0 complaint, forcing the author to put in an 
assertion expressing his assumption.
</p>
<p>
Example 13:
</p>
<pre class="example">
int Average(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (N == 0)
    X = 1;
    
  return F(Sum, N);
}


int F(int Sum, unsigned N)
{
  if (Q) return Sum / N;
  else   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>

This is a modification of Example 12, where the two conditions 
<span class="code">N == 0</span> and <span class="var">Q</span> have been 
split across the two functions.
There is still a path leading to division by 0;
the path is identical to the one in Example 12,
except that there is a call to <span class="function">F()</span> on the path.
And that changes everything.
It is no longer acceptable to report the possible division by 0.
</p>
<p>
The function <span class="function">F()</span> will fail if 
<span class="code">N == 0</span> and <span class="var">Q</span> are both true.
The programmer does feel an obligation to make it work 
if <span class="var">Q</span> is true, because <span class="var">Q</span> is being tested.
But he feels no such obligation toward <span class="code">N == 0</span>,
just like the programmer of Example 1.
The fact that a caller of <span class="function">F()</span> might test <span class="var">N</span>
cannot put any burden on the author of <span class="function">F()</span>.
Similarly, the function <span class="function">F()</span> will fail if 
<span class="code">N == 0</span> and <span class="var">Q</span> are both true.
However, the author feels no obligation to document that it must not be
called with <span class="var">Q</span> true, just because some other function invoked
might test <span class="var">Q</span>.
</p>
<p>
This is a major difference between intra-procedural paths and 
inter-procedural paths.
A path to error containing two conditions is not considered acceptable
evidence, if the second condition can be reached by some call 
to <span class="function">F()</span>, where <span class="var">N</span> is not tested.
The situation is actually the same as for macros (Example 6),
only more severe;
inter-procedural paths leading to an error are much less acceptable
to programmers than paths passing through macros.
</p>
<p>
<h1>General statement of rules of evidence</h1>

</p>
<p>
There is a set of conditions for an error to occur.
They are the tests along a path leading to the error.
Each condition has a label, called <span class="term">evidence</span>, which 
is heuristically assigned to be one of
<ul>
<li><span class="val">to prove</span>
<li><span class="val">admissible</span>
<li><span class="val">inadmissible</span>
</ul>
An error is reported provided all the conditions are consistent, and
all the <span class="val">admissible</span> conditions imply all those <span class="val">to prove</span>.
</p>
<p>
Consider example 10.
The condition for division by 0 is that <span class="code">N == 0</span>
and that is labeled <span class="val">to prove</span>.
The test <span class="code">A[I] != 0</span> is labeled <span class="val">admissible</span>
although it does not help us here.
The test <span class="code">I &lt; N</span> is labeled <span class="val">inadmissible</span> 
by our heuristic for loop conditions, and therefore
it cannot be used to prove what we would need for issuing a complaint.
</p>
<p>
The situation is different for <span class="var">Pivot</span>, which 
will be uninitialized under the <span class="val">inadmissible</span>
condition that <span class="code">I &lt; N</span> is false 
the first time it is tested.
Since there is no condition <span class="val">to prove</span>
the uninitialized complained will be issued.
</p>
<p>
Division by 0 will occur when <span class="code">N == 0</span>, which is <span class="val">to prove</span>,
and under the <span class="val">inadmissible</span>
condition that <span class="code">I &lt; N</span> is false 
the first time it is tested.
Since there is no <span class="val">admissible</span> condition to help,
the division by 0 complaint is not issued.
</p>
<p>
In example 11 there is one condition <span class="val">to prove</span>, namely 
<span class="code">I &lt; 0 || I &gt;= 10</span>.
There are two <span class="val">admissible</span> conditions 
<span class="code">I &lt;= 10</span> and <span class="code">I == 10</span>.
While the first one does not imply the condition <span class="val">to prove</span>,
the second one does.
</p>
<p>
In general, the strength of the evidence for a condition is
decided heuristically.
In addition there are parameters to control the decisions.
However, we do not encourage users to set the 
parameters themselves.
If you do not like our assumptions about what inputs are 
possible, let us know.
Such problems are usually deeper than parameter settings.
