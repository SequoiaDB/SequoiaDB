<h1>Avoiding multiple analysis of functions defined in header files </h1>

By default, BEAM does not analyse functions that are defined in header files.
However, it is very typical for C++ programs to define member functions in
header files and those do not get analysed by default. Of course, this
default setting can be changed but that has the side effect of multiple
analyses of functions that have been analysed before. That has a
detrimental effect on runtimes.
</p>
<p>
<h1>The State File</h1>

To overcome this problem we provide a "state file" which BEAM uses to
keep track of functions that have been analysed before. The state file
is specified by assigning the file name to the Tcl variable
<a href="parms.html#beam::state_file"><span class="var">beam::state_file</span></a>. 
As usual this can be done on the command
line (<span class="option">--beam::state_file=...</span>) or in a Tcl file.
</p>
<p>
BEAM will read the specified state file before it begins its analysis.
Then, for every function BEAM will first lookup whether the function is
already listed in the state file and if so, the analysis will be skipped.
At the end BEAM will update the state file and add any newly analysed 
functions.
</p>
<p>
The state file should be deleted by the user before BEAM is run
over a project. The file should not be kept between full BEAM runs,
because the second time BEAM is run over a project, BEAM will
consider all functions to have been analysed already.
</p>
<p>
The content of the state file is unspecified and subject to change
without notice.
</p>
<p>
<h1>When to specify beam::build_root</h1>

If you want to use a given state file to do a BEAM run over a set of files 
that reside in a single directory tree, no 
<a href="parms.html#beam::build_root"><span class="var">beam::build_root</span></a>
needs to be specified. Most likely this is what you want to do.
However, if you have several identical copies of your source code in different
directories and you want to do parallel BEAM runs with 
<span class="strong">the same state file</span> in those directories
then <span class="var">beam::build_root</span> should be set to point
to the corresponding root directory. It is not
mandatory to specify <span class="var">beam::build_root</span> but the runtime savings 
will be much larger if you do
specify it. Keep reading for the gory details.
</p>
<p>
In order for BEAM to decide whether a function has already been analysed
it is not sufficient to look at the function name alone. In general, there can
be many identically named functions with internal linkage in different 
source files. Those can only be distinguished by looking at the file name.
By default, BEAM uses the absolute pathname. This works fine as long as 
the source code is contained in a single directory but it breaks down
when there are multiple copies of the source code in different directories
as described above.
