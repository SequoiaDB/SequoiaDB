<h1 class="title">BEAM Myths</h1>
<hr/>

</p>
<p>
<h2>The Syntax Myth: <br> BEAM just checks syntax.</h2>

In reality we do our best not to.
BEAM relies on a separate parser, which can generate messages about syntax errors.
But BEAM proper assumes that the source code is correct syntactically.
And if it is not, BEAM tries to analyze those parts that it could parse.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Panacea Myth: <br> BEAM will catch most bugs.</h2>

Perhaps the largest category of bugs are misunderstood specifications,
which BEAM knows nothing about.
Several people have made estimates of what percentage of bugs BEAM
catches, what percentage of critical bugs it catches, 
what percentage of the bugs it catches are critical, etc.
The percentages can be counted on the fingers of one hand,
at best two hands.
You do not need your toes.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Lint Myth: <br> Lint or even compilers catch the kind of problems BEAM looks for.</h2>

There is a large intersection, but the difference lies in the accuracy of analysis.
BEAM applies much more accurate (and hence more expensive) analysis
than lint or a compiler.
That allows it to report more bugs without many false alarms.
It is very important to avoid false alarms, because otherwise
it is not worth programmers' time to see why the tool thinks there is a problem.
And without that effort BEAM complaints would suffer the same fate as 
lint complaints -- either ignored or
resolved by a change that may mask the real problem.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Distance Myth: <br> BEAM cannot catch a bug that causes a crash in modules far from the defect.</h2>

Static and dynamic tools look for very different symptoms;
the fact that the closest dynamic symptom is very far, does not say anything
about static symptoms.
Consider the following example:
</p>
<p>
Machine crashed because of division by 0,
which happened because the divisor came from a control block previously freed.
The code that incorrectly freed the control block is very far from the 
division operation.
How the hell can BEAM analyze that?
</p>
<p>
First, BEAM would not use division by 0 to detect the bug; instead it might detected it
if it saw access to freed memory,
and that may happen somewhere closer to the defect's cause.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, it is a bad idea to leave global variables containing 
pointers to freed memory. If you agree, and let BEAM report that,
then you can have a symptom very close to the cause.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Unit Test Myth: <br> BEAM can be useful only during unit test, not system test.</h2>

Whether a bug is caught during unit test or system test is not a property 
of the bug, nor the methods for bug detection.
It is determined by the symptoms you are looking for.
Consider the example in the Distance Myth.
If the symptom you are looking for is a crash then a bug may be detectable 
only during system test.
But if you chose to consider dangling pointers symptoms of something unacceptable
then the same bug can be caught during unit test.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Critical Defect Myth: <br> BEAM does catch critical defects. <br> BEAM does not catch critical defects.</h2>

The only sure way of finding out is not to fix a reported problem
and wait for a customer to find it (which has been done).
As soon as you fix any bug, any determination of whether it could be critical
is subjective.
</p>
<p>
Again consider the example in the Distance Myth.
Static analysis is useless for people who want to find the problem by detecting
the division by 0.
Static analysis is useful to those who decide never to have a dangling pointers around,
even if they will never know whether such a defensive programming practice 
prevented a customer disaster.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Evaluation Myth: <br> A tool like BEAM can be evaluated by giving it a code containing known bugs and seeing how many failures it detects.</h2>

That is true only if you do not insist on detecting the same symptoms.
</p>
<p>
For example, there was a case of a person looking for an irreproducible corrupted memory problem.
She found it using BEAM, which reported a memory leak.
A memory leak would not corrupt memory; but the bug involved freeing one variable
instead of another.
And this bug had several symptoms, one was a crash, the other was leaking the 
memory held by the variable that was actually supposed to be freed.
</p>
<p>
The moral is not to insist on detecting a crash.
Instead let the tool look for symptoms of its choosing and see 
how many bugs the programmers would be prompted to fix.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Cleanliness Myth: <br> Fixing code so as not to trigger any BEAM complaints will make it more reliable.</h2>

Suppose you hire a summer student and let him modify your software
so that it does not trigger any BEAM complaints.
You would not expect the result to be more reliable for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>If BEAM finds that something bad happens under some conditions,
it takes an expert to determine what is the right thing to happen there.</li>
<li>Fixing an uninitialized variable by initializing it at its declaration to 
some default value only masks the real problem.
It is important to see why BEAM thinks that it is uninitialized under some conditions,
conditions that were meant to be impossible.</li>
Something like an uninitialized variable may be just a symptom of an error in a condition.
<li>Any change, even done by an expert, 
caries a non-negligible chance of introducing a new bug.</li>
<li>Even if a module is fixed to reflect original intentions,
surrounding modules might already become dependent on the incorrect behavior.</li>
</ul>
The moral is that BEAM complaints should be viewed as nothing more
than a colleague's critique about a strange looking code.
</p>
<p>
<h2>The Configuration Myth: <br> BEAM needs no more configuration than a compiler.</h2>

BEAM does not require any more configuration than a new compiler,
but then you get the default behavior, which may not be satisfactory
for two reasons: false alarms and problems not caught.
</p>
<p>
You will get false alarms because
<ul>
  <li>By default BEAM assumes that all functions eventually return;
in reality you may have special functions that terminate a thread
or that report an internal error and exit, after which you do not
want any complaints reported.
  <li>Some parts of your code you do not want checked.
  <li>Some checks turned on by default are not applicable to you.
<p>
In the default setting some problems will not be caught because
  <li>The default setting turns on only the minimum checking
  <li>More problems can be caught if BEAM knows about some of your special 
functions, like those that allocate and free memory
  <li>You may have requirements on your library calls or special coding 
guidelines that BEAM cannot check unless it is told about them.
  <li>More problems can be caught if you provide disk space 
for results of inter-procedural analysis.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you want to get the most out of BEAM you should never stop providing 
more information.
