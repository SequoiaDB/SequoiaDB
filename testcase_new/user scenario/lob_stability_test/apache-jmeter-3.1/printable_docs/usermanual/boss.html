This is a fairly open-ended proposition. There are a number of questions to
be asked first, and additionally a number of resources that will be needed. You
will need some hardware to run the benchmarks/load-tests from. A number of
tools will prove useful. There are a number of products to consider.  And finally,
why is Java a good choice to implement a load-testing/Benchmarking product.

<p>
This should be a widely-used piece of hardware, with a standard
(i.e. vanilla) software installation. Remember, if you publish your results,
the first thing your clients will do is hire a graduate student to verify them.
You might as well make it as easy for this person as you possibly can.

</p>
<p>
For Windows, Windows XP Professional should be a minimum (the others
do not multi-thread past 50-60 connections, and you probably anticipate
more users than that).

</p>
<p>
Good free platforms include the linuxes, the BSDs, and Solaris Intel. If
you have a little more money, there are commercial linuxes.
This may be worth it if you need the support.

</p>
<p>

For non-Windows platforms, investigate "
<tt class="code">ulimit -n unlimited
</tt>
" with a view to
including it in your user account startup scripts (
<tt class="code">.bashrc
</tt>
 or 
<tt class="code">.cshrc
</tt>
 scripts
for the testing account).

</p>
<p>

Also note that some Linux/Unix editions are intended for server use.
These generally have minimal or no GUI support.
Such OSes should be OK for running JMeter in non-GUI mode, but JMeter GUI mode probably won't work
unless you install a minimal GUI environment.

</p>
<p>
As you progress to larger-scale benchmarks/load-tests, this platform
will become the limiting factor. So it's worth using the best hardware and
software that you have available. Remember to include the hardware/software
configuration in your published benchmarks.

</p>
<p>
<b>
When you need a lot of machines or want to test the network latency, Cloud can help you.
</b>

JMeter can easily be installed on Cloud instances as it runs on nearly any architecture available in the Cloud.
JMeter is also supported within Commercial Cloud PAAS if you don't want to manage it yourself. 

</p>
<p>
Don't forget JMeter batch (NON-GUI) mode. This mode should be used during load testing for many reasons:

<ul>


<li>
If you have a powerful server that supports Java but perhaps does not have a fast graphics implementation, or where you need to login remotely.
</li>


<li>
Batch (non-GUI) mode can reduce the network traffic compared with using a remote display or client-server mode.
</li>


<li>
Java AWT Thread used for GUI mode can alter injection behaviour by blocking sometimes
</li>


</ul>

The batch log file can then be loaded into JMeter on a workstation for analysis, or you can
use CSV output and import the data into a spreadsheet.

</font>
</td></tr>

<blockquote>
<p>
Why not Perl or C?

</p>
<p>
Well, Perl might be a very good choice except that the Benchmark package
seems to give fairly fuzzy results. Also, simulating multiple users with
Perl is a tricky proposition (multiple connections can be simulated by forking
many processes from a shell script, but these will not be threads, they will
be processes). However, the Perl community is very large. If you find that
someone has already written something that seems useful, this could be a very
good solution.

</p>
<p>
C, of course, is a very good choice (check out the Apache 
<tt class="code">ab
</tt>
 tool).
But be prepared to write all of the custom networking, threading, and state
management code that you will need to benchmark your application.

</p>
<p>
Java gives you (for free) the custom networking, threading, and state
management code that you will need to benchmark your application. Java is
aware of HTTP, FTP, and HTTPS - as well as RMI, IIOP, and JDBC (not to mention
cookies, URL-encoding, and URL-rewriting). In addition Java gives you automatic
garbage-collection, and byte-code level security.
