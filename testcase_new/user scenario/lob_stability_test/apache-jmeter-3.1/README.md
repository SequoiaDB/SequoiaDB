# Apache JMeter

## What is it?

Apache JMeter is a 100% pure Java application designed to test
and measure performance.  It may be used as a highly portable 
server benchmark as well as multiclient load generator.

Apache JMeter features include:

Ability to load and performance test many different server/protocol types:
 -  Web - HTTP, HTTPS
 -  SOAP / REST
 -  FTP
 -  Database via JDBC
 -  LDAP
 -  Message-oriented Middleware (MOM) via JMS
 -  Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)
 -  Native commands or shell scripts
 -  TCP

Full multithreading framework allows concurrent sampling by many threads
and simultaneous sampling of different functions by separate thread groups.
Careful GUI design allows faster Test Plan building and debugging.
Caching and offline analysis/replaying of test results.

Highly Extensible core:
 -  Pluggable Samplers allow unlimited testing capabilities.
 -  Several load statistics may be chosen with pluggable timers .
 -  Data analysis and visualization plugins allow great extensibility as well as personalization.
 -  Functions can be used to provide dynamic input to a test or provide data manipulation.
 -  Scriptable Samplers (BeanShell, BSF- and JSR223- compatible languages)


## The Latest Version

Details of the latest version can be found on the Java Apache 
Project web site (http://jmeter.apache.org/).

## Requirements

The following requirements exist for running Apache JMeter:

 -  Java Interpreter:

    A fully compliant Java 7 (or later) Runtime Environment is required 
    for Apache JMeter to execute.

 -  Optional jars:

    Some jars are not included with JMeter.
    If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory

    + JDBC - available from database supplier
    + JMS - available from the JMS provider
    + Bouncy Castle - available from http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html

      (currently only needed for SMIME Assertion)

 -  Java Compiler [OPTIONAL]:

    A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a
    precompiled Java binary archive. _Note that a compiler is required
    if you plan to build plugins for Apache JMeter._

## Installation Instructions

_Note that spaces in directory names can cause problems._

 - Release builds

   Unpack the binary archive into a suitable directory structure.

## Running JMeter

Change to the bin directory
Run the jmeter (Un\*x) or jmeter.bat (Windows) file.

For Windows there are also some other scripts.
Drag-drop a JMX file onto one of them:

`jmeter-n.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI test

`jmeter-n-r.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI remote (client-server) test

`jmeter-t.cmd` - loads the file ready to run it as a GUI test

## Documentation

The documentation available as of the date of this release is
also included, in HTML format, in the `printable_docs/` directory,
and it may be browsed starting from the file called `index.html`.

## Build instructions

 - Release builds

   Unpack the source archive into a suitable directory structure.
   Most of the 3rd party library files can be extracted from the binary archive
   by unpacking it into the same directory structure.
   You can also use Ant to download the required library files:

```sh
ant download_jars
```

Any optional jars (see above) should be placed in `lib/opt` and/or `lib`.

Jars in `lib/opt` will be used for building JMeter and running the unit test,
but won't be used at run-time.

_This is useful for testing what happens if the optional jars are not
downloaded by other JMeter users._

JMeter is built using Ant.

Change to the top-level directory and issue the command:

```sh
ant download_jars
```
_Only needs to be done once; will download any missing 3rd party jars_

```sh
ant
```

This will compile the application and enable you to run jmeter from the `bin`
directory.

```sh
ant test [-Djava.awt.headless=true]
```

This will compile and run the unit tests.
The optional property definition is required if the system
does not have a suitable GUI display.
