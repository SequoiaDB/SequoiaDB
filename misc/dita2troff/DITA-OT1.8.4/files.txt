PACKAGE DESCRIPTION FOR "DITA-OT1.5" 

This document describes the organization and contents of the current DITA
distribution.  These notes represent the specific organization of the
directories in the current package.

FILES IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY:

Within the root directory are the usual license, change notes, a link to
the actual readme in the doc directory, and other files related to
installation, configuration and processing for DITA:

* Files that define ant processing (build.xml and ditatargets.xml). For a
  description of the use of the ant processing capability, please see
  doc/DITA-ant.html.

* Files that configure the DITA DTDs to tools that are XML Catalog-aware.
  These are in both text and OASIS XML format.  (Schemas have no formal
  requirement for use of XML Catalogs, although some tools can make use
  of catalogs in the same way as for DTDs.)


DIRECTORIES WITHIN THE ROOT DIRECTORY:

\css
\demo
\doc
\dtd
\lib
\plugins
\resource

The "\css" directory contains sample CSS files that can be used for
displaying DITA content directly in browsers or editors that configure
their views using CSS.

The "\demo" directory contains examples of specializations that
  demonstrate how various types of information can be supported using
  DITA techniques.  This directory has the following components:
\demo\book - use of the out-dated original bookmap specialization of map
\demo\dita132 - the original, pre-OASIS version of DITA kept for
                backwards compatibility
\demo\elementref - a simple "element reference" descriptive markup
\demo\enote - the use of specialization to represent data objects
\demo\faq - a Frequently Asked Questions summary format
\demo\h2d - XSL conversion tools to convert HTML to DITA
\demo\java - validators for DITA Schemas
\demo\legacypdf - the original, demo level PDF output code


The "\doc" directory contains the core DITA description, image resources,
  and a growing library of application notes.
\doc\articles contains the DITA source for the articles that define the
DITA architecture.
\doc\langref contains the DITA source for the DITA Language Reference

The "\dtd" directory contains the core DITA definitions in XML DTD format.

The "\plugins" directory can be used to store DITA-OT plug-ins.

The "\resource" directory contains the commonly used css files and default
plugin.xml, helpset.hs and index.html for different html related output. It
also contains other resources common to toolkit builds.

The "\samples" directory has the following components:
\samples\ant_sample - sample Ant customizations for running toolkit builds
\samples\concepts - content for garage User Assistance
\samples\image - image resources for garage UA
\samples\taskbook - sample content using the OASIS bookmap specialization
\samples\tasks - content for garage UA
