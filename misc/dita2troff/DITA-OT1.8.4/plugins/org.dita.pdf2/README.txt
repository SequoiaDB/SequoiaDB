Welcome to Idiom FO output for the DITA Open Toolkit
======================================================

Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven 
by XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent formatter. 
It is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and 
renders the resulting pages to a specified output. Output formats  
currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP, XML (area tree representation), 
Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser extent, RTF and TXT. The primary 
output target is PDF. 

Installing Idiom FO output
=========================================

* If you are using a full-easy-install package, you don't need to do additional
  work to run pdf conversion. Just use the pdf transtype to build your pdf output.

* If you are NOT using a full-easy-install package, some additional efforts are
  needed to get pdf conversion run. You will need the following software:

- Apache FOP: Apache FOP can be obtained from http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
  This plugin also requires Saxon 6.5.3. But if you are using JDK 1.5 or 
  newer, you will need Saxon 6.5.5 or newer which has fixes for JDK 1.5
  compatibility. Download Saxon 6.5.5 from http://saxon.sourceforge.net.

- ICU4J: You can find this library by clicking on the "Download ICU" link
  at http://icu.sourceforge.net. Look for the ICU4J downloads. ICU4J is
  an optional jar that will give you better collation of index entries.

 To install and use with the Open Toolkit's distribution,

1. Install the DITA Open Toolkit.
2. Unzip this plugin into an Open Toolkit installation's
   demo directory.
3. Install Apache FOP into demo/fo/fop. The minimum requirements are to place
   fop.jar into demo/fo/fop/build/ and all library jar files provided in Apache
   FOP package into demo/fo/fop/lib/.
4. Copy "fop.xconf", which is shipped together within the Apache FOP package
   in the conf directory, to demo/fo/fop/conf/.
5. Edit the copied fop.xconf, add this line:
   <strict-validation>false</strict-validation>
   below the line "<base>.</base>". Save and close fop.xconf.
6. If you are using JDK 1.5, install saxon.jar in FO plug-in's library directory demo/fo/lib/.
7. Install the ICU4j jar (optional) into OT's library directory lib/icu4j.jar
8. From the Open Toolkit directory, run "ant -f integrator.xml"

At this point, the FO output is fully integrated into the Open
Toolkit's pipeline. The plugin infrastructure will detect the FO
plugin and provide a "pdf" output: this will invoke this FO
output instead of the previous FOP-based output. Invoke with a command
line like:

java -jar lib/dost.jar /i:doc/DITA-readme.ditamap /transtype:pdf

If you are using the startcmd.bat/sh script, make sure the classpath in that 
script lists saxon.jar before xalan.jar. 

About the index extensions
==========================

The index generation feature adds extensions to DITA's indexterm that can be
expressed as content of that element. These extensions are expressed in a 
FrameMaker-like syntax in the element's textual content, and provide 
functionality not yet available in the standard indexterm element. They also
help migration from legacy FrameMaker content. For example, the following 
generates a "see also" entry:

	<indexterm>Carp:<$nopage>see also Goldfish</indexterm>
	
As:

	Carp, 34
	   see also Goldfish	
	
The extended syntax consists of:

	: (colon)       Separates levels in an entry
	; (semicolon)   Separates entries in a marker
	[] (brackets)   Specifies a special sort order for the entry
	<$startrange>   Indicates the beginning of a page range
	<$endrange>     Indicates the end of a page range
	<$nopage>       Suppresses the page number in the entry (for example, in
	                a See entry)
	<$singlepage>   In a marker that contains several entries, restores the 
	                page number for an entry that follows a <$nopage>
	                building block

DITA 1.1 indexing elements have been implemented in this plugin that
should make these extensions unnecessary. You can now express see/see
also, sort order and page ranges using standard DITA 1.1 elements.

About /Customization
====================

This directory is where the custom files live that make up customized
versions of the FO publishing outputs.  Idiom's FO publishing output will 
look for certain files here to override the standard ones. Things you can 
currently override include:

  - Custom XSL via fo/xsl/custom.xsl and fo/attrs/custom.xsl
  - Layout overrides via fo/layout-masters.xml
  - Font overrides via fo/font-mappings.xml
  - Per-locale variable overrides via common/vars/[locale].xml
  - I18N configuration via fo/i18n/[locale].xml
  - Index configuration via fo/index/[locale].xml

When customizing any of these areas, modify the relevant file(s) in
/Customization.  Then, to enable the changes in the publishing process, 
you find the corresponding entry for each file you modified in 
/Customization/catalog.xml. It should look like this:

    <!--uri name="cfg:fo/attrs/custom.xsl" uri="fo/attrs/custom.xsl"/-->

Remove the comment markers "!--" and "--" to enable the change:

    <uri name="cfg:fo/attrs/custom.xsl" uri="fo/attrs/custom.xsl"/>

Your customization should now be enabled as part of the publishing process.

Idiom has provided template files that you can start with throughout
this directory structure.  These files end in the suffix ".orig" (for
example, "catalog.xml.orig").  To enable these files, make a copy of
them and remove the ".orig" suffix.  For example, copy
"catalog.xml.orig" to "catalog.xml".  You can then make modifications
to the copy.

Idiom's FO output also provides a general configuration file called
"build.properties" that allows you to control the publishing process.
To modify these settings, copy "build.properties.orig" to
"build.properties" and then modify the relevant options.
